The alimentary tract is one continuous tube, beginning at the mouth\nand progressing through the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and ending with\nthe anus.

The\ngastrointestinal system can be affected pathologically by ulceration, inflammation, infection,\ntumors (both benign and malignant), neurologic dysfunction, and mechanical obstruction.  \n**Digestion: Anatomy and Physiology**  \nThe mouth is the site of initial digestion. Here, food is mechanically broken down by chewing\nand is lubricated by saliva produced by the salivary glands. There is some breakdown of starch in\nthe mouth, but this is of minimal digestive importance. After food is chewed, it is passed to the\nesophagus through the neurologically mediated process of swallowing. Once food enters the\nesophagus, it is forced downward by gravity and the rhythmic contractions (peristalsis) of the\nmuscles that make up the outer two layers of the esophagus.

Food passes from the esophagus into\nthe stomach through the lower esophageal sphincter, located just below the level of the diaphragm.\nThis gastroesophageal junction (GE junction) is also known as the Z-line because of its zigzag\nappearance.  \n**Figure 1.**  \n-----  \nThe stomach is anatomically divided into several areas (Figure 1). The major function of the\nstomach is to continue the mechanical grinding of the food bolus and to enhance the chemical\nprocess of digestion. This is done through the secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCL) and pepsin.\nFor the most part, the stomach does not absorb nutrients, though it is the main site of alcohol\nabsorption. The stomach\u2019s other role is the production of intrinsic factor, a protein that is necessary\nfor the absorption of vitamin B12.",
    "20": "absorption. The stomach\u2019s other role is the production of intrinsic factor, a protein that is necessary\nfor the absorption of vitamin B12.  \nThe food is passed from the stomach through the pylorus, a muscular channel, into the first part\nof the small intestine, the duodenum. Digestive enzymes, produced in the pancreas, and bile,\nproduced in the liver, empty into the duodenum through a common opening known as the ampulla\nor papilla of Vater. This fluid, along with locally produced pH neutralizing bicarbonate, mixes\nwith the food, allowing for the major chemical breakdown of protein, carbohydrates, and fats into\nsmaller, simpler, absorbable forms. As the nutrients pass through the rest of the small intestine\n(the jejunum and finally the ileum), they are absorbed through multiple projections of the mucosa\ncalled the villi. The terminal ileum is critical for the absorption of vitamin B12 and the reabsorption",

The small intestine on average is 22 feet long, and the villi produce many more feet\nof absorptive surface.  \nThe residual solution that is not absorbed by the small intestine passes through the ileocecal\nvalve, located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, into the cecum, the first part of the large\nintestine (colon) (Figure 2). The appendix, a long, non-functional, narrow tube, also opens into\nthis area of the large intestine. The colon extends up the right side of the abdomen (the ascending\ncolon), takes a bend to the left at the liver (the hepatic flexure), and crosses the upper abdomen\n(the transverse colon).

The structure that controls the fecal outflow is called the anus.  \n**Figure 2.**  \n-----  \nThe major function of the large intestine is to reabsorb water and electrolytes passing from the\nsmall intestine and to control the elimination of the digestive waste material. To accomplish this\nprocess, the transit time (forward motion) slows greatly in the colon.

For example, apthous ulcers (flat erosions of the mouth) can\nbe associated with Crohn\u2019s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. A candida fungal infection\nof the mouth (i.e., thrush) can be a sign of an immune deficiency state such as acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the result of inhaling steroid medication.

Treatment requires first determining the\nunderlying etiology. When a primary motor disorder (e.g., esophageal spasm) is diagnosed\nthrough esophageal manometry (i.e., pressure monitoring of the esophagus) and barium x-ray\nstudies, the treatment often consists of the promotility medication metoclopramide (Reglan[\u00ae]) or\nantispasmodic agents such as nifedipine (Procardia[\u00ae]) and nitroglycerin.

Achalasia is the\nfailure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. This results in significant dilation of the\nesophagus. It is treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation or surgery.

It is estimated there will be 174,650\nnew cases in 2019 and 31,620 deaths from prostate cancer. This represents roughly 20% of all\nnew cancer diagnoses in males, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. In the years 2013 to 2015,\na male\u2019s estimated lifetime risk for being diagnosed with prostate cancer was approximately 1 in\n9; interestingly, this is down from an estimate of 1 in 6 lifetime risk just 8 years previously, due\nnot to a true decrease in incidence but rather decreases in screening and identification of indolent\nprostate cancer.  \nIncidence rates increased dramatically in the early 1990s, peaking in 1992 at 237.4 cases per\n100,000.

This number dropped significantly in 2012 with 114.1 cases per 100,000, a number close\nto that seen in the early to middle 1980s. This decrease may be due to the U.S. Preventive Services\nTask Force revised recommendations for screening for prostate cancer that appeared in May 2012,\nwhich advised against use of routine PSA testing.  \nDeath rates from prostate cancer also increased in the early 1990s, but not as dramatically as\ndid the incidence, and peaked at 39.3 deaths per 100,000.

The prostate cancer death rates stabilized 2013 through 2016 after two decades\nof steep reductions (4% per year) that had been attributed to an earlier stage at diagnosis due to\nPSA testing and advances in treatments.[1,2,3] Black males have the highest incidence rates of\nprostate cancer in the world (237.4 cases per 100,000 in the years 1975 to 2012) and death rates\nthat are more than double those of their Caucasian counterparts in the United States (63.37 versus\n28.27 per 100,000 in that same time period).

Most males, if they live long enough, will\neventually develop some evidence of the disease. Small foci of carcinoma can be found in 29%\nof males between the ages of 30 and 40 and in 64% of males ages 60 to 70 on pathologic\nexamination, although most of these lesions are not invasive and not of clinical significance.\nInvasive disease is uncommon before the age of 50 but increases rapidly thereafter.

However, the RR varies with the\nnumber of relatives affected and their age of onset. The RR can range up to 17 for individuals\nwith affected brothers. The rates are higher if the index cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed\nat a young age.  \nIt is estimated that as much as 57% of the risk of prostate cancer could be explained by heritable\nfactors.

In addition, the positive predictive\nvalue (the likelihood that a cancer is present with an abnormal examination) is fairly low as well.\nThe predictive value increases if physical findings are interpreted in conjunction with age and PSA\nlevel. Because not all tumors produce PSA elevations, an abnormal DRE should not be ignored\neven though the PSA level is in the normal range. In those situations, stability over time and the\npresence of negative biopsies and/or favorable MRI findings are the most important factors in\nruling out a malignancy.  \n_Prostate Specific Antigen Testing_  \nIt was the introduction of PSA testing in 1987 that revolutionized the diagnosis of prostate",

PSA is a serine protease glycoprotein that is produced almost exclusively by the epithelial\ntissue of the prostate gland. It is produced by all prostatic cells, normal and malignant, and thus is\nnot specific for cancer. Levels normally increase with age and the size of the gland. What\ndistinguishes prostate cancer is that it produces more PSA per unit volume than does benign tissue.\nThis increased production, and resultant higher levels, is the basis for its value in the screening\nprocess. The PSA molecule is the same in benign and malignant tissue; it is the amount produced\nper unit volume and detectable on testing that is different.

In one study, 6.6% of males\nwith a PSA value < 0.5 ng/ml actually had prostate cancer.[10]  \nThe specificity of PSA for the diagnosis of malignancy is reduced by the fact that a number of\nother factors can also increase the level. These include:  \n1. benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)\n2. prostatitis\n3. prostatic massage\n4. surgery\n5. instrumentation (biopsy or resection) of the gland.  \nDRE probably does not affect levels significantly, but recent ejaculation can raise the value\nslightly, rarely more than 1.0 ng/ml.

The result is\nthat screening for prostate cancer using PSA represents a balancing act between achieving\nadequate detection or sensitivity while avoiding over-diagnosis.  \nThe upper limit of normal for PSA values in most laboratories is 4.0 ng/ml. However, this\nrange was established in an older population, and it has been recognized that levels vary with age.\nWith that in mind, age-dependent upper limits of normal have been often used to improve the\naccuracy of the screening process.

Overall, in populations typically\nscreened, the positive predictive value for a PSA >4.0 is approximately 30% (i.e., an individual\nwould have prostate cancer found on biopsy). In addition, a significant number of individuals with\ncancer have PSA readings in the normal range, with a negative predictive value estimated to be\naround 85%.

Although controversial in clinical circles, probably the\nmost important for underwriting is the PSA velocity, or the rate of rise of the PSA level. PSA\nproduction by prostate cancer is out of physiologic control and levels tend to increase\nexponentially. A rate of rise of the PSA greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year is highly suggestive of\nmalignancy and is useful even if the total PSA level is in the normal range. Some clinical\norganizations favor a lower threshold in the 0.35 to 0.40 ng/ml per year range. For optimal\naccuracy, one should have at least three readings spaced out over at least 18 months when assessing\nPSA velocity.[11]  \n_Controversy_",

Proposed insureds will likely continue to be tested for\nPSA by their attending physicians in the near term. This could lead to a potential asymmetry of\ninformation and the possibility of anti-selection on the part of proposed insureds.  \nIn addition, it should be kept in mind that there is a difference in the value of PSA testing\nbetween the insurance and clinical environments. The PSA assay is a very good test for finding\nadvanced, incurable disease with early mortality, which makes it highly valuable in the insurance\narena, even when it is of limited value clinically.[12,13,14]  \n-----  \n_Improving the performance of PSA_",

PSA normally circulates in the blood in two forms\u2014one bound to another protein\n(alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) and the other unbound or \u201cfree.\u201d Prostate cancer disproportionately\nproduces more bound PSA and, thus, reduces the relative percentage of circulating free or unbound\nmaterial. Therefore, measuring the free PSA and its relative percentage of the total PSA level can\nimprove the diagnostic accuracy of the test.

Surprisingly, there are no good studies that directly compare the outcomes\nof each form of treatment, especially with the more modern techniques employed for each.[5] In\ngeneral, overall long-term outcomes have been better with surgical therapy.

Males who are frail or who have significant comorbid medical conditions are more\nlikely to be treated with radiation. The result is that the surgically treated group tends to be, in\ngeneral, a younger and healthier population. One way that researchers have tried to adjust for this\nphenomenon is to report findings in terms of disease-specific survival, instead of overall survival.  \nSecond, individuals treated with radiation are, of necessity, staged clinically so that the precise\nextent of their tumor is uncertain. Surgical cases are staged pathologically. Thus, the precise\nextent of the tumor can be tied to the clinical outcomes. The result is that a clinical stage T2 and\na pathologic stage T2 can be substantially different lesions and have different outcomes that have\nnothing to do with the form of therapy used.",

Surgical techniques have\nnot changed to such a large extent. This makes comparisons between surgery and radiation and\namong the various forms of radiotherapy difficult, especially over long-term follow-up.  \nRadical prostatectomy involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and is primarily\nreserved for males who are otherwise reasonably healthy and have a projected life expectancy of\nat least 10 years.

In this\ntreatment, seeds of iodine-125 or palladium-103 are implanted directly into the prostate gland in\norder to deliver the radiation dose directly to the tumor. This type of therapy is reserved primarily\nfor smaller, low risk lesions.

Radiation causes damage to the cells, which will only lead to their death when the cells\ndivide. Since prostate tumor cells divide slowly, this delayed necrosis can take some time to\nmanifest itself. For this reason, post treatment PSA values decrease slowly and it can take two to\nthree years to reach its lowest level. The nadir, or lowest level reached, and the time it takes to\nachieve that level are both prognostic factors for disease recurrence and mortality.

However, most tumors eventually become androgen-independent and resistant\nto the treatment. Chemotherapy is used for those who fail hormonal manipulation, but it is of\nlimited long-term benefit.[35,36 ]  \n_Cryotherapy_  \nIn some patients who are not candidates for, or who refuse, surgery and radiation therapy,\ncryosurgery can be used to destroy the prostatic tissue.

This mortality experience is supported by studies that have looked at\nlong-term survival after radical prostatectomy.  \nFor surgery, the risk is divided between organ-confined tumors and tumors that extend outside\nthe prostate.

The remaining\n20% are called in situ lesions and have cells that show malignant changes but have not invaded\nthrough the basement membrane. For the year 2019, the number of new cases of breast cancer in\nthe U.S. is expected to be around 268,600 in females (30% of all cancers in females, excluding\nnon-melanoma skin cancers) and 2,670 in males.

It is estimated there will be 42,260 deaths from\nthe disease (41,760 females and 500 males).  \nThe incidence rates for breast cancer increased significantly during the 1990s. Most of that\nincrease was in non-invasive or in situ lesions while the incidence rate for invasive tumors\nremained relatively flat. Despite this increase in incidence, the death rates from breast cancer\ndecreased significantly during that same time in many developed countries, including the United\nStates. The decrease has been attributed to two key factors: improved screening with\nmammography, with the subsequent earlier diagnosis of smaller tumors, and improvements in\ntherapy. Most recently, incidence rates have also decreased, most likely due to the populationwide reduction in hormone replacement therapy.[1,2,3,4,5]  \nRisk Factors  \n_Age_  \nThe most important risk factor for the development of breast cancer is age.

    "287": "Risk Factors  \n_Age_  \nThe most important risk factor for the development of breast cancer is age. The incidence rates\npeak in the 75-79 year age range with a modest decline in later years. Expressed another way, the\nodds for developing breast cancer for females is 1 in 51 from birth to age 49, 1 in 43 at ages 50 to\n59, 1 in 29 from age 60 to 69, and 1 in 15 from age 70 and up, for an overall lifetime risk of 1 in 8\n(12.4%).[2 ]  \n_Estrogen Exposure_  \nProlonged exposure to estrogens is important in the development of breast cancer. Factors that\nincrease exposure clearly increase risk. These factors include: early menarche, older age at first\npregnancy, and delayed menopause.

About 10-20% of\nthe females with breast cancer have a first-or second-degree relative who is also affected. The risk\nclearly increases with the number of affected relatives and the age at which those relatives\ndeveloped a tumor. For those with a history of cancer in first-degree relatives (mother, sister, or\ndaughter), the risk varies depending on whether the onset in the family member was\npremenopausal or postmenopausal and whether there was bilateral disease.

If the tumor occurred in\nmore distant relatives, the risk for the individual is only modestly increased (on the order of that\nseen with hormonal therapy use) if the diagnosis was made in the family member before\nmenopause, and not at all if the diagnosis was made after menopause. Breast cancer in a male\nrelative also increases the risk.  \nAbout 5% of females with breast cancer have a single gene mutation that places them at high\nrisk. Two of the identified genes whose mutations are associated with increased risk are BRCA1\nand BRCA2, located on chromosomes 17 and 13 respectively. These mutations increase the\nlifetime risk of breast cancer to about 50-85%. The risk of ovarian cancer and selected other",

The Li Fraumeni, Peutz-Jeghers, and Cowden syndromes\nare other examples of these conditions.[1 ]  \n_Benign Breast Disease_  \nSome forms of benign breast disease can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. The\nkey factors in this process appear to be the presence of proliferation, or increased cell turnover,\nand alterations of the normal cellular structure, or atypia, on the biopsy specimen.

The risk is further modified by age and family history. The highest\nrisk is in females under age 45 with atypical hyperplasia (RR=6.99). In contrast, for females with\na strong family history and non-proliferative lesions, the relative risk is 1.62. An increased risk of\nbreast cancer is also noted in females with increased breast density.[1,6]  \n_Environmental Factors_  \nCertain environmental factors and their association with an increased or decreased risk of breast\ncancer:  \n1.

High levels of physical activity over a prolonged period of time can suppress estrogen  \nlevels and reduce risk to some extent.

Approximately 20-25% of breast cancers in the U.S.\nare considered to be DCIS. As with invasive breast cancer, the risk increases with age, and it is\nuncommon in females younger than 30. DCIS can be diagnosed by mammography by its classic\nfinding of clustered microcalcifications. The mortality risk from these tumors is very small.

The tumors at greatest risk for\nrecurrence are those with a higher nuclear grade and those that show comedonecrosis on biopsy.\nYounger age at onset, a larger size, the presence of a palpable nodule, and the occurrence of\nmultiple in situ lesions also increase the risk of recurrence.[8,9,10 ]  \nWhat has been called lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is not a cancer, and many now prefer to\nconsider is as lobular neoplasia, a designation that also includes atypical lobular hyperplasia\n(ALH).

Most of those invasive cancers will be ductal and can occur 15 years or more after the\ndiagnosis of the in situ lesion. The presence of LCIS increases the lifetime risk of invasive cancer\napproximately 8-fold, or roughly 1% per year, which is about twice the risk incurred with ALH.[11]  \n_Invasive Cancers_  \nMost invasive cancers are adenocarcinomas, and the most common of the adenocarcinomas\n(85%) is invasive ductal carcinoma.

These drugs block the enzyme (aromatase) that converts\nandrogens to estrogens in adipose tissue, the adrenal glands, and the breast tumors themselves\n(some tumors produce their own supply of estrogen), thereby cutting off the supply of this hormone\nto the cancer. SERMs like tamoxifen are also an option and can have a more favorable side effect\nprofile, however they are less effective.

The recurrence, and mortality,\nrisk with smaller and lower grade tumors is much less, but nevertheless, can extend for many years.\nThe rate of recurrence remains elevated, and fairly consistent, even 10-20 years out, and mortality\nfrom the disease has been observed 20 years or more after diagnosis.[32,34,42] This long-term pattern\nof recurrence and mortality risk is illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 5.",

Worldwide, the\nincidence of colorectal cancer is much higher in industrialized countries. This is attributed to\ndifferences in diet, with higher fat and less fiber consumption in the more developed areas.[1,2,3,4]  \nRisk Factors  \nAbout 80% of colon cancer cases are sporadic, i.e., not related to known hereditary mutations.\nAs noted above, age is clearly a risk factor, but individuals with a younger age of onset tend to\nhave more aggressive disease while those who are older at diagnosis tend to present at earlier\nstages.  \nAside from the known hereditary syndromes (see below), a family history of colon cancer over",

For the most part, the development of colorectal\ncancer follows a logical pattern of sequential genetic mutations that transform the normal colonic\nmucosa into invasive cancer. The first mutation in the sequence leads to the formation of\nadenomatous polyps. Subsequent mutations lead to the formation of frank carcinoma. Finally,\nmutations in yet other genes permit the tumor to metastasize.[3,8]  \nThe risk of cancer development in colonic polyps varies with the size of the lesions. Polyps\nless than 5 mm in size are considered diminutive and carry a negligible risk of malignancy.\nGrowths with a diameter of 5-10 mm are considered small, and those more than 10 mm are\nconsidered large.

Among\nadenomatous polyps, the risk of cancer varies with the type of polyp:  \n1.

In addition polyp development, and consequently cancer\nformation, tends to be a multicentric disease. The occurrence of multiple lesions simultaneously\nis a common phenomenon.[5]  \n-----  \nInherited Colon Cancer Syndromes  \nAbout 10% of colon cancers occur as part of hereditary syndromes with a clear-cut genetic\npredisposition. These syndromes include conditions with and without an increase in the number\nof polyps.

The most important hereditary condition without a\ndramatic increase in the number of polyps is hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).  \nFAP is an autosomal dominant condition (i.e., if the individual has the gene, he has the disease)\nassociated with a mutation in the APC gene on chromosome 5.

Individuals with this condition have about a 70-80% lifetime\nrisk of developing colorectal cancer. Cancer tends to occur at an earlier age (mean age 44) and\nmultiple tumors are common. The precursor lesion is an adenoma that is flat, rather than polypoid,\nwhich tends to occur proximally. Individuals with this syndrome are at risk for a variety of other\nmalignancies as well, especially endometrial and ovarian cancer (39% and 9% risk by age 70,\nrespectively).[3,5,6,9,10,11]  \nScreening and Diagnosis",

Elevations\nprior to surgery are a poor prognostic indicator and are a marker for a higher risk of recurrence. If\nlevels are abnormal before treatment, they should return to the normal range in four to six weeks\nafter curative surgery. Failure to do so indicates persistent disease. In addition, if levels return to\nthe normal range and then increase again, it is a powerful indicator for the presence of metastasis.\nDespite this fact, the CEA level has not been found helpful in choosing appropriate candidates for\nadjuvant therapy.[6]",

The effect of each of these for colon cancer is\nsummarized using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database,\nin Figures 1-4. The most important of these are extension of the tumor through the bowel wall and\ninto adjacent structures and the presence of lymph node metastasis. These indicate spread of tumor\ncells beyond the local area of origin. Of note, the mortality risk between well- and moderatelydifferentiated lesions is fairly small. However, the survival with poorly-differentiated tumors is\nconsiderably worse.[24]",

Two percent of young females are affected by bulimia.\nProblems related to induced vomiting are common, such as dental enamel erosion, esophagitis,\nreflux, and aspiration.  \nObesity can be defined as excessive eating without appropriate or inappropriate compensatory\nmechanisms and leading to an increased body mass index (BMI).  \nThe key to underwriting a history of an eating disorder is to look for several years of stability\nin body weight and symptoms and to look for comorbidities, especially depression, obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), and substance abuse.  \n**Suicide**  \nSuicide is the intentional ending of one\u2019s life by violent means, such as gunshot, hanging,",

Normally there is 5-15 mL of very slippery\nfluid between these two plural surfaces, allowing for smooth movement of one surface over the\nother. In disease states, abnormal collections of fluid occurs between these two layers (i.e, a pleural\neffusion). Anatomically the lungs are divided into lobes, with the right lung having three lobes\nand the left lung having two. The lobes, in turn, are divided into two to five segments each.  \nAir reaches the lungs via the nose, mouth, trachea, and then through a branching system of\ntubes, collectively called the bronchial tree.

The trachea in the neck and\nupper chest bifurcates to the right and left lung and then successively divides to the lobes and\nsegments, finally ending in terminal air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are tiny air sacs surrounded\nby capillary where the blood exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen. (The walls of both the alveoli\nand the capillaries are only one cell thick.) The bronchial tree divides about 27 times before\nreaching the alveoli. Respiration is the gas exchange that takes place in the alveoli by which\noxygen (O2) is taken up by the capillary red blood cells and carbon dioxide (CO2) is expelled into\nthe alveolus and removed by exhalation.",

Once\nthe blood has reached the alveoli and carbon dioxide has been exchanged for oxygen, oxygenated\nblood is then returned by the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. As in the circulation to other\nareas, the pulmonary circulation is a branching system in which the arteries taking blood to the\nlungs finally end in tiny capillaries. The capillaries then merge to form the veins that return blood\nto the heart. The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lung to the left atrium and\nthen left ventricle, to be distributed to the rest of the body.  \nThe terminology may be confusing as we normally think of _veins as carrying deoxygenated_",

It has been estimated that if the entire alveolarcapillary membrane were stretched out, the surface area would cover two tennis courts.  \n**Physiology**  \nThe lungs are inflated primarily by the diaphragm. With inspiration (inhalation), chest muscles\nmove the ribs up and out. At the same time the diaphragm, an upwardly-domed muscle separating\nthe lungs from the abdomen, moves downward.

An example of how a\ntiny change in pH can alter body function is the hyperventilation syndrome.

Each kidney is about five inches (13 cm) long and weighs\nabout four ounces (110 gr).  \nThe kidney\u2019s primary purpose is:  \n1. to filter the nitrogenous products of metabolism (e.g., urea and creatinine) from the blood\n2. to maintain water and electrolyte homeostasis.  \nThe kidney also produces two hormones that have nothing to do with its excretory function:",

Filtration takes place in the nephron\nof the kidney, which has two parts:  \n1. the glomerulus\n2. the tubule.  \nThe kidneys receive about 20% of the cardiac output through the renal arteries. Each renal\nartery divides into smaller and smaller arteries after it enters the kidney until the smallest arteries\nterminate in a looped coil of capillaries \u2013 the glomerulus (also called the glomerular tuft).

Peristaltic contractions of the muscles in the ureter walls\nforces urine downward. Small quantities of urine empty into the bladder about every 15 seconds.\nThere are sphincter muscles at the ureterovesical junction (where the ureters enter the bladder) that\nprevent urine from flowing backward into the kidneys when the bladder contracts during urination.\nA normal bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (approximately half a liter) of urine for up to four hours\ncomfortably.

This mechanism explains why so many kidney disorders are associated\nwith high blood pressure.

For example, with a specific gravity of 1.015 mg/dl, 15 mg/dl of protein would be about\nthe upper limit of normal.  \nCommon benign causes of proteinuria are:  \n1. exercise, fever, stress, excessive cold, vaginal contamination\n2. orthostatic proteinuria \u2013 a condition in which an individual has proteinuria when upright  \n-----",

Hepatitis C and HIV are now  \nthe most common infectious causes of glomerulonephritis in developed countries.

Fewer than 5% develop end-stage\nrenal failure, with complete recovery within two weeks being the rule in most cases.\n2. IgA nephropathy (Berger\u2019s disease) is caused by deposition of immunoglobulin A in the  \nkidney, which produces an inflammatory reaction in the glomeruli. It is a slowly\nprogressive, indolent disease in the majority of cases. Treatment of IgA nephropathy has\nbeen disappointing, although ACE inhibitors can slow progress of the disease and use of\nprednisone and azathioprine has benefitted some individuals.\n3.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It  \nis thought to be part of the spectrum of glomerulonephropathies that includes minimal\nchange disease.

The affected glomeruli tend to be found in the area closest to the\nmedulla of the kidney. A biopsy can miss the lesions because disease begins at the\ncorticomedullary junction and spreads outwards through the cortex. About half of those\naffected have hypertension and hematuria and 30% exhibit renal insufficiency.\n5. Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease/Goodpasture\u2019s syndrome is caused by  \ncirculating antibodies that attack the glomerular basement membrane.

Renal vasculitis is a severe disease with necrotizing glomerular damage caused by  \ncirculation of antibodies that damage small blood vessels. It can affect primarily the\nkidneys (i.e., idiopathic necrotizing glomerulonephritis) or it can be secondary to\nWegener\u2019s granulomatosis or to a microscopic polyarteritis.

Prognosis is extremely variable\nwith about a third of cases having complete remission, another third left with mild nonnephrotic proteinuria, and the final third progressing to end-stage renal failure.\n8.

The disorder mimics rheumatoid arthritis in\nsome ways, though the symptoms tend to be more proximal and involve the muscles more than the\njoints. The etiology of PMR is unknown. The pathogenesis is inflammation of the small blood vessels\nin the muscle and likely around the joints as well.  \nGiant cell arteritis (GCA), or temporal arteritis as it is sometimes called, is a form of vasculitis\ninvolving inflammation of the large arteries.

Common symptoms of giant cell arteritis include pain in the jaw\nmuscles on eating or speaking, as well as severe temporal headaches and tenderness of the scalp and\nin the area of the temples. The peak incidence of giant cell arteritis is in the 60\u201375-year-old age group.\nFemales are affected three times as often as males. The annual incidence (i.e., the number of new\ncases per 100,000 of general population each year) is in the range of 20 per 100,000 over age 50 with\na prevalence of about 2,000 per 100,000 over age 50.",

The most important of these\nnutrients is oxygen, which is carried by the red blood cells. Blood also carries end products of\nmetabolism to the organs of excretion. White blood cells and circulating antibodies form a natural\ndefense against microorganisms and foreign antigens. Platelets and coagulation factors in the\nplasma maintain hemostasis. Plasma and cellular components exchanging elements result in a\ndynamic equilibrium.  \n**Hematopoiesis**  \nThe bone marrow, one of the largest organs of the body, is the principal site of blood cell\nformation.

These precursors of\nred blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets multiply and mature in the bone marrow,\ndifferentiating into their appropriate cell lines prior to release into the peripheral blood.  \nHematopoiesis is the term given to the production of blood cells. At birth and throughout life,\nthe bone marrow is the only site of normal hemopoietic activity. As an individual ages, the\nhemopoietic tissue or red marrow is slowly replaced by fatty tissue or yellow marrow. This occurs\nfrom the periphery of the body inward toward the axial skeleton.

While the number of bone\ncavities containing red marrow decreases at adulthood, the increased size of these hemopoietic\ncavities compensates for the loss of some marrow sites. Bone marrow samples for diagnostic\nstudies are usually taken from the posterior iliac crest or from the sternum.  \nIt is postulated that all cell lines develop from pluripotential stem cells. These stem cells can\ndifferentiate into the precursors of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The\ndifferentiation to a specific cell line can be triggered by physiologic changes that cause a demand\nfor increased production of one cell type. Stem cells committed to red blood cell production\nbecome cells called erythroblasts.

As the cell nears maturity, it\nextrudes its nucleus, and it is released into the peripheral circulation. The newly released cell is\ncalled a reticulocyte. A normal mature red blood cell is a biconcave disk saturated with\nhemoglobin. This shape allows maximum oxygen saturation as well as the ability to navigate the\nmicrocirculation of organ systems without damage to the cell.  \n-----  \nThe principal factor in the regulation of red blood cell production appears to be the hormone\nerythropoietin, which is produced in the kidney. When oxygen transport to the tissues is impaired,\nas it is in anemia, cardiovascular disorders, or the low oxygen environment of high altitude,\nerythropoietin activity is increased.

This causes stem cells to commit to the red blood cell line, as\nwell as to increase the rate of cell division, and to trigger the early release of reticulocytes. The\nbone marrow has the capacity to adjust its red blood cell production to ten or more times the normal\nrate.  \n**Hemoglobin Synthesis and Degradation**  \nThe main function of the red blood cell is the transport of oxygen to the tissues; hemoglobin is\nthe carrier substance. The hemoglobin molecule consists of a heme portion containing iron and a\nglobin portion. The globin portion consists of two pairs of chains composed of amino acids, the\nbuilding blocks of proteins. Genetic variations in the structure of these chains are responsible for\nthe various hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell or thalassemia. Heme combines with oxygen",
    "1095": "building blocks of proteins. Genetic variations in the structure of these chains are responsible for\nthe various hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell or thalassemia. Heme combines with oxygen\nand carbon dioxide reversibly. In the lung, where oxygen tension is high, hemoglobin is 95%\nsaturated with oxygen. In the tissues, where oxygen tension is low, the oxygen dissociates readily.  \nThe life span of a normal red blood cell is approximately 120 days. As the life cycle comes to\nan end, the cell is removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system. This system is\ncomposed of the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Special cells called macrophages\nengulf or phagocytize the aging red blood cells in the bone marrow. Misshapen cells are removed\nby the spleen. Following phagocytosis, the hemoglobin molecule is broken down into iron,\nprotoporphyrin, and globin. Protoporphyrin undergoes further degradation to eventually become",

It is one of the most frequently ordered of all blood tests.\nSignificant findings in a CBC give valuable information concerning a patient\u2019s diagnosis, response\nto treatment, prognosis, and recovery. The CBC is used as a diagnostic tool in the emergency\nroom or physician\u2019s office when a patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, jaundice, or outright\nacute blood loss.

The severity of an anemia and the appropriate\nprognosis can be directly related to the corresponding blood counts. The CBC is also used as a\nscreening test. It can be done routinely with hospital pre-admission testing, in the emergency\nroom, during routine physicals, and even with employment physicals. CBC testing is also\nperformed frequently due to the ease of specimen procurement through venipuncture and the small\namount of specimen needed. It is important for underwriters to understand that when a physician\norders a CBC, it is not necessarily to diagnose anemia.  \nThe CBC consists of two parts. The tests in the first part, sometimes called the hemogram,\ninclude:  \n-----  \n1. white blood cell count (WBC)\n2. red blood cell count (RBC)\n3. hemoglobin (HGB)\n4. hematocrit (HCT)\n5. red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC)\n6. platelet count (PLT).",

White blood cells, also called\nleukocytes, defend the body against foreign organisms by phagocytosis of bacteria and production\nof antibodies. An increased number of white blood cells is termed leukocytosis while reduced\nlevels are referred to as leukopenia. There are many causes of leukocytosis including:  \n1. acute bacterial infection (the most common cause) with white counts in the 15,000 to 30,000  \nrange\u2014Counts as high as 45,000 can be seen with pneumococcal pneumonia.\n2. physical stimuli such as heat, cold, pain, surgery, malignancies, and drug reactions\n3. emotional stimuli such as stress.",

Leukopenia (a reduction in the number of white blood\ncells) is often seen with viral or rickettsial infection or with an overwhelming bacterial infection.  \nRed Blood Cell Count  \nThe red blood cell count determines the total number of erythrocytes per volume of blood.\nNormal values differ for males and females with males having higher values. Decreased red blood\ncell counts are seen in anemia. Anemia, by definition, is a decrease in the number of circulating\nerythrocytes, and/or the quality of these cells. Anemia can be caused by:  \n1. a decrease in red blood cell production or reduction in hemoglobin level\n2. an increase in red blood cell destruction",

Anemia and polycythemia will be\ncovered in more detail later in this chapter.  \n-----  \nHemoglobin  \nHemoglobin is the main component of erythrocytes. It serves as the vehicle for both oxygen\nand carbon dioxide transport. Normal values differ for males and females. The oxygen-carrying\ncapacity of blood is directly proportional to the hemoglobin concentration rather than the number\nof red blood cells. Some red blood cells contain more hemoglobin than others. For this reason,\nthe hemoglobin value tends to be more important in the evaluation of anemia than the red blood\ncell count. Decreased hemoglobin values are found in anemia from any cause, including",

Increased\nhemoglobin levels are seen in polycythemia, pulmonary disorders, and congestive heart failure.\nThere is a tendency for smokers to have elevated hemoglobin levels.  \nHematocrit  \nThe hematocrit, also called the packed cell volume, is the volume of erythrocytes compared to\nthe volume of whole blood in a sample. The word hematocrit means \u201cto separate blood,\u201d which\nunderscores the mechanism of the test. Blood is centrifuged and red cells are forced to the bottom\nof a capillary tube.

Very often the hemoglobin and\nhematocrit tests (i.e., H & H) are done separately without the remainder of the CBC tests.  \nRed Blood Cell Indices  \nThe red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC) are calculated values determined from the\nsame blood sample used for the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values. The\nindices are used to define cell size (i.e., normocytic, macrocytic, microcytic) and hemoglobin\ncontent (i.e., normochromic, hypochromic).

An increased\nhemoglobin concentration can indicate spherocytosis, in which the red cell is shaped like a sphere\nrather than the normal biconcave disk.  \n-----  \nPlatelet Count  \nThe platelet count is also considered a part of the CBC.

The degree of anisocytosis, microcytosis, or macrocytosis is noted as slight,\nmoderate, or marked.  \nVariation in red blood cell shape is called poikilocytosis. Red blood cells can take on numerous\nabnormal shapes. The normal erythrocyte shape is round. Abnormal cells can appear oval-shaped,\npear-shaped, helmet-shaped, target-shaped, or teardrop-shaped.

The hemoglobin value is proportional to the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and is, thus,\nthe most important parameter. Hemoglobin values below 12.0 require further investigation and a\nvalue below 10.0 should be considered clinically significant. Next, the MCV and MCH should be\nchecked to classify an anemia as normocytic, microcytic, or macrocytic, and normochromic or\nhypochromic.  \n-----  \nAlthough the following information is not completely diagnostic, it can serve as a helpful\nguideline when dealing with and identifying commonly classified anemias.  \n1.

Anemias with elevated MCV (macrocytic) can be due to folic acid deficiency, vitamin B12  \ndeficiency, or a problem with intrinsic factor that transports vitamin B12 to the intestine.\nElevated MCV can also be due to excess alcohol intake.  \nThe complete blood count provides an important series of parameters used in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of hematologic disorders.

Just as with a cold or fever, anemia\nis a sign or symptom of an underlying disease process that must be identified. These signs and\nsymptoms show a great deal of variation in their relationship to the degree of anemia. For example,\nacute hemorrhage can cause circulatory collapse, shock, or even death from sudden blood volume\nloss.

The morphologic classification is based on\nmicroscopic observation and works well with the simplified analysis discussed earlier in the\nreading. Anemias are divided into:  \n1. normocytic/normochromic anemia (acute blood loss, aplastic, anemia of chronic disease  \nsuch as renal insufficiency or rheumatoid arthritis)\n2. microcytic/hypochromic anemia (iron deficiency, thalassemia)\n3. macrocytic anemia (vitamin B12, folic acid deficiency).",

Blood loss anemia can be due to\nacute blood loss or chronic blood loss, and the blood loss can be internal or external. Acute blood\nloss can occur following trauma or can be due to a disease process that significantly damages\nvascular integrity.

This loss of total blood volume becomes more\nimportant than the loss of circulating red blood cells. When blood loss is gradual, the total blood\nvolume is restored by expansion of the plasma volume. Acute blood loss anemia is\ncharacteristically a normocytic, normochromic anemia.  \nAcute blood loss can be due to hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract due to malignant tumor,\nulcer, diverticulosis, or esophageal varices. Obstetrical problems such as ectopic pregnancy and\nplacenta previa can also result in hemorrhage. Other causes of severe acute blood loss include\nruptured aortic aneurysm, trauma resulting in spleen rupture, and bleeding associated with\nhemophilia.",

When the hemoglobin returns to normal and\nthere has been no adverse reaction to transfusion, the individual can be considered to have no extra\nmortality risk. When blood loss is due to a disease process, the underwriter must assess based on\nthe appropriate cause.  \n-----  \n**Iron Deficiency Anemia**  \nIron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia worldwide and can initially mimic the\nsymptoms of blood loss anemia.

Iron deficiency in adults is usually caused by chronic\nblood loss due to ulcer, esophageal varices, carcinoma, menstrual bleeding, hemorrhoids, or\nulcerative colitis. Malabsorption of iron is rare.  \nIron deficiency anemia can be described as a three-stage process:  \n1.

By increasing their content of lipid material, these\nplaques can rupture through the thin fibrotic cap or can fissure with subsequent exposure of the\ninternal constituents of the atherosclerotic plaque to the flowing blood.

Several approaches are being pursued:  \n1. One is aimed at reducing risk factors, especially cholesterol levels. Preliminary evidence  \nsuggests that lipid-lowering therapy can act on the lipid-laden plaques more prone to\nrupture, possibly preventing their progression and inducing their regression thereby\nreducing the risk of acute coronary events.\n2.

Myocardial ischemia occurs when myocardial oxygen supply cannot\nmeet myocardial oxygen demand in a region of the ventricle.  Coronary artery disease is often\ncalled ischemic heart disease (IHD) because it is only when the coronary atherosclerotic process\ncauses ischemia that it manifests clinically.  \nMyocardial infarction (MI) refers to the irreversible myocardial cell injury and death that occurs\nfollowing prolonged ischemia.

Almost all acute myocardial infarctions result from coronary\natherosclerotic lesions, generally with superimposed thrombosis.  \nMyocardial oxygen supply is determined by the amount of oxygen delivered by coronary blood\nflow. Since oxygen extraction by the myocardium is nearly maximal at rest, myocardial oxygen\nsupply is very dependent on the ability to increase coronary artery size and, thus, blood flow\n(coronary flow reserve).  \nWhile a complex host of factors will determine myocardial oxygen supply, myocardial oxygen\ndemand is rather simply controlled by:  \n1. heart rate\n2. contractility of the myocardium\n3. left ventricular wall tension.  \nBrief periods of oxygen supply/demand imbalance (as short as several minutes) will promptly",

    "1261": "The vascular system consists of three highly specialized components: the arterial, venous, and\nlymphatic systems. The arterial system consists of vessels of varying size and carries oxygenated\nblood to the tissues of the body after it leaves the heart. The venous system is responsible for\ntransporting deoxygenated blood back to the heart and lungs. The lymphatic system is a separate\nvessel system and is responsible for carrying excess fluid from the tissue spaces back to the\nbloodstream.  \n**Anatomy and Physiology**  \nUnderstanding the peripheral arterial system and its diseases requires knowledge of vascular\nstructural elements and their arrangement within vessel walls. Vessels above a certain lumen\ndiameter generally consist of three defined layers: the intima, media, and adventitia.  \n1. The intima is a single layer of endothelial cells on the innermost section of the vessel wall.\n2. Media refers to the middle section of the vessel wall and consists of smooth muscle cells",

Media refers to the middle section of the vessel wall and consists of smooth muscle cells  \nsurrounded by collagen and elastic tissue.\n3. Adventitia, the outermost covering of the vessel wall, consists of a mixture of collagen,  \nelastic tissue, smooth muscle, nerve fibers, vasa vasorum, and lymphatic vessels that\naccommodate lymphatic flow to nourish and remove metabolic waste products from the\nvessel wall.  \nThe structural elements most common to arterial vessels consist of five separate tissue\ncomponents:  \n1. endothelium\n2. basement membrane\n3. elastic tissue\n4. collagen\n5. smooth muscle  \nThe endothelium is comprised of a flat layer of endothelial cells lining the entire vascular\nsystem.

Collagen (a major protein\nof the white fibers of connective tissue, cartilage, and bone) resists stretching and thereby prevents\nover-distention of the vasculature. Smooth muscle provides the contracting component of the\nvascular system that regulates vasoconstriction and dilation.  \nThe vascular system is further subdivided into elastic arteries (the aorta and major pulmonary\narteries), muscular arteries (the renal and femoral arteries), arterioles, and capillaries.

These arteries are capable\nof constricting and dilating to allow varying degrees of blood flow to certain tissues according to\ntheir needs. Muscular arteries are major regulators of systemic blood pressure.  \nArterioles are small arteries, which lead, in turn, to capillaries. Capillaries, the smallest blood\nvessels, have an endothelium but no intima. Red blood cells pass single file through the capillary\nbed at a very slow pace. This combination of slow movement and thin capillary walls is ideally\nsuited for the exchange of substances between the tissues and blood. Blood eventually passes into\nthe post-capillary venules and, sequentially, through the collecting venules and the small, medium,\nand large veins, thus transporting the blood back to the right side of the heart via the vena cavae.",

In the\nextremities, where blood flows against gravity, a system of valves prevents reverse flow or pooling\nof blood.  \nLymphatics are thin-walled, endothelial-lined channels that collect excess fluid in the tissue\n(i.e., interstitial tissue fluid) and inflammatory cells, transporting them back to the blood.  \n**Atherosclerosis**  \nAtherosclerosis is a pathologic condition that causes coronary, cerebral, aortic, and peripheral\narterial diseases.

Fatty streaks transition into atherosclerotic plaques\nand these plaques can then develop a well-defined lipid core covered by a fibrous cap. Advanced\nlesions may have a necrotic lipid core with calcification, and more advanced lesions may also have\nhemorrhage.

Blood pressure\ncuffs are applied at various levels based on the results of ABI testing and location of the clinical\nsymptoms of claudication. Each cuff is inflated individually, and a pressure gradient difference is\ndetermined. A 20 mmHg or greater reduction or difference in pressure between the segments\nalong the same leg, or when compared to the same level in the opposite leg, is considered\nsignificant.  \n_Segmental Volume Plethysmography_  \nPlethysmography is used in conjunction with segmental limb pressures to locate the level of",

The list of potential uses is\nquite extensive, but the most common uses are as follows:  \n1. acute and chronic pain \u2013 Multiple drug trials have shown marijuana to be safe and effective  \nfor many different types of pain including neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, arthritis,\nmigraines, other types of headaches, musculoskeletal disorders, dysmenorrhea, and pain\nfrom HIV, strokes, and many other conditions.[27,28,31] Marijuana has also proven to be a",

Anecdotal  \nevidence for this condition is very strong and has led to the creation of a specialized strain\nthat controls intractable seizures and is primarily used in children. However, actual studies\nhave been limited and show marijuana to only be useful in some types of seizures and\npossibly only those that cannot be controlled by other medications. Studies have shown\nthat THC limits the spread of epileptogenic activity inside the brain as well as increasing\nthe effects of other anticonvulsants.[30,31,32,33,34]\n3.  gastrointestinal disorders \u2013 The appetite-stimulating effect of marijuana is particularly",

Cannabinoid receptors have been detected in\nenteric nerves and can be activated pharmacologically to provide gastroprotection and\nreduce gastric and intestinal motility as well as intestinal secretions. Marijuana has been\nfound to be helpful in treating nausea, vomiting, gastric ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome,\ninflammatory bowel disease, secretory diarrhea, paralytic ileus, and gastroesophageal\nreflux disease.

Which of these medications being used would not affect the\nunderwriter\u2019s decision; only the extent of the disease and the degree of control achieved through\ntreatment would be pertinent?
