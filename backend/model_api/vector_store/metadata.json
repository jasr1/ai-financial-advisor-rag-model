    "6": "On a late December afternoon, in the waning twentieth century, Sam exited a subway car and found the artery to the escalator clogged by an inert mass of people, who were gaping at a station advertisement. Sam was late.  \nHe had a meeting with his academic adviser that he had been postponing for over a month, but that everyone agreed absolutely needed to happen before winter break. Sam didn\u2019t care for crowds\u2014being in them, or whatever foolishness they tended to enjoy en masse. But this crowd would not be avoided. He would have to force his way through it if he were to be delivered to the aboveground world.",
    "7": "Sam wore an elephantine navy wool peacoat that he had inherited from his roommate, Marx, who had bought it freshman year from the Army Navy Surplus Store in town. Marx had left it moldering in its plastic shopping bag just short of an entire semester before Sam asked if he might borrow it. That winter had been unrelenting, and it was an April nor\u2019easter (April! What madness, these Massachusetts winters!) that finally wore Sam\u2019s pride down enough to ask Marx for the forgotten coat. Sam pretended that he liked the style of it, and Marx said that Sam might as well take it, which is what Sam knew he would say. Like most things purchased from the Army Navy Surplus Store, the coat emanated mold, dust, and the perspiration of dead boys, and Sam tried not to speculate why the garment had been surplussed.",
    "8": "But the coat was far warmer than the windbreaker he had brought from California his freshman year. He also believed that the large coat worked to conceal his size. The coat, its ridiculous scale, only made him look smaller and more childlike.  \nThat is to say, Sam Masur at age twenty-one did not have a build for pushing and shoving and so, as much as possible, he weaved through the crowd, feeling somewhat like the doomed amphibian from the video game Frogger. He found himself uttering a series of \u201cexcuse mes\u201d that he did not mean. A truly magnificent thing about the way the brain was coded, Sam thought, was that it could say \u201cExcuse me\u201d while meaning \u201cScrew you.\u201d  \n-----",
    "9": "\u201cCan\u2019t you go around?\u201d a man in a black and green macram\u00e9 hat yelled at Sam.  \n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cDammit, I almost had it,\u201d a woman with a baby in a sling muttered as Sam passed in front of her.  \n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Sam said.  \nOccasionally, someone would hastily leave, creating gaps in the crowd.  \nThe gaps should have been opportunities of escape for Sam, but somehow, they immediately filled with new humans, hungry for diversion.  \nHe was nearly to the subway\u2019s escalator when he turned back to see what the crowd had been looking at. Sam could imagine reporting the congestion in the train station, and Marx saying, \u201cWeren\u2019t you even curious what it was? There\u2019s a world of people and things, if you can manage to stop being a misanthrope for a second.\u201d Sam didn\u2019t like Marx thinking of him as a misanthrope, even if he was one, and so, he turned. That was when he espied his old comrade, Sadie Green.",
    "10": "It wasn\u2019t as if he hadn\u2019t seen her at all in the intervening years. They had been habitu\u00e9s of science fairs, the Academic Games league, and numerous other competitions (oratory, robotics, creative writing, programming). Because whether you went to a mediocre public high school in the east (Sam), or a fancy private school in the west (Sadie), the Los Angeles smart- kid circuit was the same. They would exchange glances across a room of nerds\u2014sometimes, she\u2019d even smile at him, as if to corroborate their d\u00e9tente\u2014and then she would be swept up in the vulturine circle of  \n-----",
    "11": "He had known that she had gone to MIT and had wondered if he might run into her when he got into Harvard. For two and a half years, he had done nothing to force such an occasion. Neither had she.  \nBut there she was: Sadie Green, in the flesh. And to see her almost made him want to cry. It was as if she were a mathematical proof that had eluded him for many years, but all at once, with fresh, well-rested eyes, the proof had a completely obvious solution. There\u2019s Sadie, he thought. Yes.",
    "12": "He was about to call her name, but then he didn\u2019t. He felt overwhelmed by how much time had passed since he and Sadie had last been alone together. How could a person still be as young as he objectively knew himself to be and have had so much time pass? And why was it suddenly so easy to forget that he despised her? Time, Sam thought, was a mystery. But with a second\u2019s reflection, he thought better of such sentiment. Time was mathematically explicable; it was the heart\u2014the part of the brain represented by the heart\u2014that was the mystery.  \nSadie finished staring at whatever the crowd was staring at, and now she was walking toward the inbound Red Line train.",
    "13": "Sadie finished staring at whatever the crowd was staring at, and now she was walking toward the inbound Red Line train.  \nSam called her name, \u201cSADIE!\u201d In addition to the rumble of the incoming train, the station was roaring with the usual humanity. A teenage girl played Penguin Cafe Orchestra on a cello for tips. A man with a clipboard asked passersby if they could spare a moment for Muslim refugees in Srebrenica. Adjacent to Sadie was a stand selling six-dollar fruit shakes. The blender had begun to whir, diffusing the scent of citrus and strawberries through the musty, subterranean air, just as Sam had first called her name. \u201cSadie Green!\u201d he called out again. Still she didn\u2019t hear him. He quickened his  \n-----",
    "14": "\u201cSadie! SADIE!\u201d He felt foolish. \u201cSADIE MIRANDA GREEN! YOU  \nHAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!\u201d  \nFinally, she turned. She scanned the crowd slowly and when she spotted Sam, the smile spread over her face like a time-lapse video he had once seen in a high school physics class of a rose in bloom. It was beautiful, Sam thought, and perhaps, he worried, a tad ersatz. She walked over to him, still smiling\u2014one dimple on her right cheek, an almost imperceptibly wider gap between the two middle teeth on the top\u2014and he thought that the crowd seemed to part for her, in a way that the world never moved for him.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s my sister who died of dysentery, Sam Masur,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cI died of exhaustion, following a snakebite.\u201d  \n\u201cAnd of not wanting to shoot the bison,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s wasteful. All that meat just rots.\u201d  \nSadie threw her arms around him. \u201cSam Masur! I kept hoping I\u2019d run into you.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m in the directory,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cWell, maybe I hoped it would be organic,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cAnd now it is.\u201d",

She gestured in front of her, toward the advertisement. For the first time, Sam registered the 60- by-40-inch poster that had transformed commuters into a zombie horde.  \nSEE THE WORLD IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.  \nTHIS CHRISTMAS, THE GIFT EVERYONE WANTS IS THE MAGIC EYE.  \n-----",
    "16": "\u201cYou disapprove?\u201d Sadie said.  \n\u201cThis can be found in any dorm common room on campus.\u201d  \n\u201cNot this particular one, Sam. This one\u2019s unique to\u2014\u201d  \n\u201cEvery train station in Boston.\u201d  \n\u201cMaybe the U.S.?\u201d Sadie laughed. \u201cSo, Sam, don\u2019t you want to see the world with magic eyes?\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m always seeing the world with magic eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m exploding with childish wonder.\u201d  \nSadie pointed toward a boy of about six: \u201cLook how happy he is! He\u2019s got it now! Well done!\u201d  \n\u201cHave you seen it?\u201d Sam asked.  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it yet,\u201d Sadie admitted. \u201cAnd now, I really do have to catch this next train, or I\u2019ll be late for class.\u201d  \n\u201cSurely, you have another five minutes so that you can see the world with magic eyes,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cMaybe next time.\u201d",
    "17": "\u201cSurely, you have another five minutes so that you can see the world with magic eyes,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cMaybe next time.\u201d  \n\u201cCome on, Sadie. There\u2019ll always be another class. How many times can you look at something and know that everyone around you is seeing the same thing or at the very least that their brains and eyes are responding to the same phenomenon? How much proof do you ever have that we\u2019re all in the same world?\u201d  \n-----",
    "18": "\u201cSam I am.\u201d  \nShe sighed as she heard the rumble of her train leaving the station. \u201cIf I fail Advanced Topics in Computer Graphics, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d She repositioned herself so that she was looking at the poster again. \u201cYou do it with me, Sam.\u201d  \n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Sam squared his shoulders, and he stared straight ahead.  \nHe had not stood this near to Sadie in years.  \nDirections on the poster said to relax one\u2019s eyes and to concentrate on a single point until a secret image emerged. If that didn\u2019t work, they suggested coming closer to the poster and then slowly backing up, but there wasn\u2019t room for that in the train station. In any case, Sam didn\u2019t care what the secret image was. He could guess that it was a Christmas tree, an angel, a star, though probably not a Star of David, something seasonal, trite, and broadly appealing, something meant to sell more Magic Eye products.",
    "19": "Autostereograms had never worked for Sam. He theorized it was something to do with his glasses. The glasses, which corrected a significant myopia, wouldn\u2019t let his eyes relax enough for his brain to perceive the illusion. And so, after a respectable amount of time (fifteen seconds), Sam stopped trying to see the secret image and studied Sadie instead.  \nHer hair was shorter and more fashionable, he guessed, but it was the same mahogany waves that she\u2019d always had. The light freckling on her nose was the same, and her skin was still olive, though she was much paler than when they were kids in California, and her lips were chapped. Her eyes were the same brown, with golden flecks. Anna, his mother, had had similar eyes, and she\u2019d told Sam that coloration like this was called heterochromia.",
    "20": "At the time, he had thought it sounded like a disease, something for his mother to potentially die from. Beneath Sadie\u2019s eyes were barely perceptible crescents, but then, she\u2019d had these as a kid too. Still, he felt she  \n-----",
    "21": "\u201cI saw it!\u201d she said. Her eyes were bright, and she wore an expression he remembered from when she was eleven.  \nSam quickly turned his gaze back to the poster.  \n\u201cDid you see it?\u201d she asked.  \n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw it.\u201d  \nSadie looked at him. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d  \n\u201cIt,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIt was amazingly great. Terribly festive.\u201d  \n\u201cDid you actually see it?\u201d Sadie\u2019s lips were twitching upward. Those heterochromic eyes looked at him with mirth.  \n\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to spoil it for anyone else who hasn\u2019t.\u201d He gestured toward the horde.  \n\u201cOkay, Sam,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cThat\u2019s thoughtful of you.\u201d  \nHe knew she knew that he hadn\u2019t seen it. He smiled at her, and she smiled at him.  \n\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange?\u201d Sadie said. \u201cI feel like I never stopped seeing you. I feel like we come down to this T station to stare at this poster every day.\u201d  \n\u201cWe grok,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cWe do grok. And I take back what I said before. That is the Sammest thing you could have said.\u201d",

    "23": "\u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong square,\u201d he repeated.  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the \u2018wrong square\u2019?\u201d  \n\u201cYou\u2019re in Harvard Square, when you should be in Central Square or Kendall Square. I think I heard you\u2019d gone to MIT.\u201d  \n\u201cMy boyfriend lives around here,\u201d Sadie said, in a way that indicated she had no more she wished to say on that subject. \u201cI wonder why they\u2019re called squares. They\u2019re not really squares, are they?\u201d Another inbound train was approaching. \u201cThat\u2019s my train. Again.\u201d  \n\u201cThat\u2019s how trains work,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s true. There\u2019s a train, and a train, and a train.\u201d  \n\u201cIn which case, the only proper thing for us to do right now is have coffee,\u201d Sam said. \u201cOr whatever you drink, if coffee\u2019s too much of a clich\u00e9 for you. Chai tea. Matcha. Snapple. Champagne. There\u2019s a world with infinite beverage possibilities, right over our heads, you know? All we have to do is ride that escalator and it\u2019s ours for the partaking.\u201d",
    "24": "\u201cI wish I could, but I have to get to class. I\u2019ve done maybe half the reading. The only thing I have going for me is my punctuality and attendance.\u201d  \n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Sam said. Sadie was one of the most brilliant people he knew.  \nShe gave Sam another quick hug. \u201cGood running into you.\u201d  \nShe started walking toward the train, and Sam tried to figure out a way to make her stop. If this were a game, he could hit pause. He could restart, say different things, the right ones this time. He could search his inventory for the item that would make Sadie not leave.  \nThey hadn\u2019t even exchanged phone numbers, he thought desperately.  \n-----",
    "25": "And yet, he knew himself and he knew he was the type of person that never called anyone, unless he was absolutely certain the advance would be welcomed. His brain was treacherously negative. He would invent that she had been cold toward him, that she hadn\u2019t even had a class that day, that she had simply wanted to get away from Sam. His brain would insist that if she\u2019d wanted to see him, she would have given him a way to contact her.",
    "26": "He would conclude that, to Sadie, Sam represented a painful period of her life, and so, of course, she didn\u2019t want to see him again. Or, maybe, as he\u2019d often suspected, he meant nothing to her\u2014he had been a rich girl\u2019s good deed. He would dwell on the mention of a boyfriend in Harvard Square. He would track down her number, her email address, her physical address, and he would never use any of them. And so, with a phenomenological heaviness, he realized that this very well could be the last time he ever saw Sadie Green, and he tried to memorize the details of what she looked like, walking away, in a train station, on a bitter cold day in December. Beige cashmere hat, mittens, and scarf. Camel-colored three-quarter-length peacoat, most definitely not from the Army Navy Surplus Store.

All the time.\u201d  \n\u201cHere.\u201d She pressed a 3.25-inch disk into his hands. \u201cThis is my game.  \nYou\u2019re probably super busy but give it a play if you have the time.

There was a Nintendo console, he promised, which was rarely used on weekday afternoons. Sadie and Alice already had a Nintendo, but Sadie had nothing else to do for the next five hours until Sharyn could drive her back home. It was summer, and she had already finished reading The Phantom Tollbooth for the second time, which was the only book she\u2019d brought with her that day. If Alice hadn\u2019t gotten pissed off, the day would have been filled with their usual activities: watching their favorite morning game shows, Press That Button! and The Price Is Right; reading Seventeen magazine and giving each other personality quizzes; playing Oregon Trail or any of the other educational games that had come preloaded on the twenty-pound laptop",

A world that lacked shared jokes and music and sweaters and par-baked brownies and sister skin casually against sister skin, under the blankets, in the darkness, and most of all, lacking Alice, the keeper of the innermost secrets and shames of Sadie\u2019s innocent heart. There was no one Sadie loved more than Alice, not her parents, not her grandmother. The world sans Alice was bleak, like a grainy photograph of Neil Armstrong on the moon, and it kept the eleven-year-old up late at night.

Poetic fragments fell from the top of the screen and, using a quill that shot ink as it tracked along the bottom of the screen, the player had to shoot the fragments that added up to one of Emily Dickinson\u2019s poems.

(He loved Tetris because it was fundamentally creative\u2014a game about building and figuring out how to make pieces fit.) With each of the game\u2019s levels, you assembled widgets that had more pieces and greater complexity, and you had less and less time to accomplish the assemblies.

She realized, in retrospect, that the one and a half years she\u2019d spent at MIT before she met Dov had been incredibly lonely. She hadn\u2019t made any real friends. And to go from having no friends to having Dov as your friend was an intense experience. He was like a bright, warm light over everything in her life. She felt lit up, turned on. There was no one better to talk to about games. There was no one better to run ideas by. Yes, she loved him, but she also liked him.",

Alice was clever, but she had the kind of cleverness that verged on the unkind, and this had only gotten worse in the years since she had been diagnosed with leukemia. Sadie didn\u2019t want Sam viewed through her sister\u2019s acute and often unforgiving lens.  \nAnd so, when Alice saw Sam at the hospital, Alice\u2019s first instinct was to ignore him.  \n\u201cYou\u2019re Sadie\u2019s sister, right?\u201d Sam said. \u201cI\u2019m Sam.\u201d  \n-----",

How does she not topple over?\u201d  \nDov said. \u201cKojima\u2019s brilliant, though.\u201d  \n\u201cYes,\u201d Sadie said, wedging her character into an air vent.  \nThe Thai food arrived. Dov made conversation as if it were a normal night, and not their last supper. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. She drank a bit of the wine he poured her\u2014she would never be much of a drinker\u2014and she felt light-headed, distantly nauseous, but not drunk. She felt too light- headed to make any of the clever comments about wine she\u2019d learned.  \n\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Dov said. He leaned across the table and he kissed her, and she felt too tired to insist that if he was breaking up with her, the least he could do was let her go without a final fuck. Because she was cool,",

    "132": "\u201cDov,\u201d she said. She wanted to say no. But her mouth didn\u2019t make the words, and in the end, she decided, what was the difference? She had had sex with him many times before. And she had liked having sex with Dov.  \nHe took off her tights and her dress and her underwear, and he ran his hand up and down her body, in an appraising way, like a farmer inspecting land he was about to sell. \u201cI am going to miss you,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to miss this.\u201d She imagined she was not in her body, but back in the world of Metal Gear Solid. The character you play in Metal Gear Solid is called Solid Snake, whose main antagonist is Liquid Snake, who is constructed from the same genetic material as you. The profundity of this struck Sadie in this moment\u2014yes, what greater enemy does one have than oneself? And wasn\u2019t she to blame for all of this more than Dov? He had said it would be trouble if she came to his apartment, and still she had gone. If someone tells you there will be trouble, believe them.",
    "133": "When the cab arrived, he walked her down to the street.  \n\u201cFriends?\u201d he said.  \n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sadie said. She handed him his key, without waiting for him to ask for it.  \nHe hugged her, deposited her in the cab, and closed the door.  \nAs the cab headed down Massachusetts Avenue, she felt hot in her winter coat and like she couldn\u2019t breathe, so she asked the driver if she  \n-----",
    "134": "4  \nThe day after Christmas, Sam sent Sadie an email: Hello Stranger, I\u2019ve played your game twice now, and I want to talk to you about it! Let\u2019s get together when you\u2019re back from the holidays. Say Hi to our old friend California for me.\u2014S.A.M. P.S. I\u2019m glad we ran into each other.  \nShe did not immediately reply, the fact of which did not trouble Sam.  \nIn those days, a person might not be able to check her email when she was away from school.  \nBy the middle of January, she still hadn\u2019t replied, and he began to worry that his email hadn\u2019t been received. He decided to send another.  \nWhile he waited for her response, he played Solution again. At that point, he had played through the game, alone, three times. The first time he played, he didn\u2019t get any of the information, just went for points, and he received the rank of Grand Nazi Collaborator. The second time he played, he took all the information but still solved the levels as quickly as possible.",
    "135": "He was given the rank of Facilitator. The last time he played, he received all the information and played the levels as slowly as he could while still leveling up. He received the rank of Conscientious Objector. Sam believed that Conscientious Objector was the best possible rank you could obtain in Solution, though he hadn\u2019t gone into the code to confirm it.  \nAs Sam played, he began to take notes on the game. He thought the game was clever, but he also thought there were small things she might improve. At the same time, there were other small things that had been done so well,  \n-----",
    "136": "The thing he most wanted to talk to her about was the game on a macro level. His biggest note was that the game should have greater complexity.  \nSolution, he felt, was fantastic as an academic exercise. But wouldn\u2019t it be even better if you could open another part of the game if you chose the moral path. After a while, if you used your points for any of the information, the mystery was obvious and the game became repetitive.  \nWouldn\u2019t it be better if those who played well enough and morally enough could figure out how to reroute the factory\u2019s output? The simulation, Sam felt, was incomplete, and thus, not fully satisfying. The simulation was incomplete because it didn\u2019t have a call to action. The only feeling a player could have at the end of Sadie\u2019s game was nihilism. Sam fully got what she was trying to do, but he also believed that she would have to do more if she were to make games that people loved, not just games that people admired.",
    "137": "He felt excited when he was coming up with these thoughts for Sadie.  \nHe felt excited in a way he didn\u2019t feel when he worked on \u201cAlternative Approaches to the Banach-Tarski Paradox\u2026\u201d The words of Anders Larsson came back to him: \u201cTo be good at something is not quite the same as loving it.\u201d After playing Solution, he knew what he would love (and what he thought he would be good at): he would love to make a game with Sadie Green. And as soon as she wrote back, he would convince her that this was what they should do.  \nAnother week passed, and she still hadn\u2019t replied. Harvard\u2019s reading period was over; Sam had finished all his exams, and the new term was about to begin. Normally, Sam would have taken the hint and forgotten that he had ever encountered Sadie Green in the subway station. But Solution wouldn\u2019t let him. She had given him the game for a reason, he felt, and he had to talk to her, even if it was for the last time. The Readme file contained her email  \n-----",

He rarely used his cane\u2014even though it was medically necessary, he felt it made him look affected, like a twenty-one-year-old Mr.  \nMonopoly\u2014but on this occasion he used it. This, he felt, was business.  \nHe arrived at Sadie\u2019s apartment, and he rang the bell. At the last second, he worried that it was an old address on Sadie\u2019s Readme, and that he would have come all this way for nothing.  \nAfter about five minutes, a roommate answered. Sam said he was looking for Sadie, and the roommate looked suspiciously at Sam for a beat, before deciding he was harmless. \u201cSadie!\u201d the roommate called. \u201cThere\u2019s a kid out here to see you.\u201d  \nSadie emerged from her bedroom.

Her MIT sweatshirt had reddish and whitish stains on it. And even though the sweatshirt was baggy, he could tell that she was unusually thin underneath it. Her hair was matted and dirty, like an animal who had been in the wild a long time. She had\u2014it must be said\u2014an odor. Sam surmised that this wasn\u2019t the result of one day of sleeping in.  \n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sam asked. Six weeks ago, she had appeared fine.  \n\u201cSure,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d  \n-----",

I walked all this way from Central Square, and it would be great if I could sit down a minute.\u201d  \nShe looked at his cane and at his foot. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said wearily.  \nSam followed Sadie into her bedroom. The curtains were drawn, and there were clothes and other detritus everywhere. This wasn\u2019t like the Sadie he had known. He asked if something had happened.  \n\u201cWhy would you care? We aren\u2019t real friends, remember?\u201d Sadie met Sam\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd it\u2019s rude to not call before you show up at someone\u2019s apartment.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t have your number. And you weren\u2019t emailing me back,\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cI suppose I\u2019ve fallen behind on my email correspondence, Samson.\u201d  \nSadie got back into bed and put her head under the covers. \u201cI need to get some sleep.\u201d Her voice was muffled by the sheets. \u201cShow yourself out.\u201d",

Heavy cream card stock, raised text, vellum-lined envelope. But Sam was old enough to have noticed that simple things were often the most expensive. He held the invitation to his nose and he took a certain pleasure in the scent of fine paper. Sam didn\u2019t think it smelled like money, because money was dirty. It smelled rich and clean, like a hardcover from a bookstore, like Sadie herself.",
    "143": "Sam set the invitation on the back of his desk and considered the envelope separately. The paper proved an irresistible temptation. He loosened its seams with steam from the tap and turned the envelope into a flat sheet of paper. He took out his favorite Staedtler Mars Lumograph pencil and began to draw a maze on the rescued paper. Sam did not always know what he was drawing when he began a maze, but this time, he found himself drawing a series of circles and curves, and these circles somehow became Los Angeles. The maze started on the Eastside, in Echo Park, where Sam lived, and ended on the Westside, in the Beverly Hills flats, where Sadie lived. It wound through West Hollywood, up the Hollywood hills to Studio City, back down the hills to East Hollywood, Los Feliz, and Silver Lake, before finally circling around to Koreatown and Mid-City.

Sam wouldn\u2019t tell them what had happened, aside from saying that she hadn\u2019t been the person he thought she was.  \nSam set down his pencil and looked at Dong Hyun. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t want to go. I don\u2019t know any of Sadie\u2019s friends.\u201d  \n\u201cYou\u2019re Sadie\u2019s friend,\u201d Dong Hyun said.  \nSam shook his head, no. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t. She was just being nice.\u201d  \nSeveral weeks later, Sadie called Sam on the phone. They hadn\u2019t spoken for two months, and her voice sounded high-pitched and strange.  \n\u201cMy dad needs to know if you\u2019re coming. You didn\u2019t send back the response card.\u201d  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI might have something that day.\u201d  \n\u201cWell, could you let me know when you know?

It\u2019s not as good as Solution, but it\u2019s still somewhat fun,\u201d Sam reported.  \nMarx sat down next to Sam, and Sam handed him the keyboard so that he could play a round.  \nBecause",

Astro Boy, or one of the many wisecracking little brothers of manga. As for his personal style: Sam looked like Oliver Twist, during the Artful Dodger years, if Oliver Twist had been from Southern California and a low-level pot dealer instead of a pickpocket. Sam had dark curly hair that he wore parted in the middle and bluntly cut, just above his shoulders. He wore cheap John Lennon\u2013style wire-rimmed glasses and one of those rough hemp striped parkas that are sold in Mexico. His blue jeans were holey and faded to almost white, and he paired his Teva sandals with thick white athletic socks. \u201cI\u2019m Sam,\u201d he said, his voice a bit reedy, as if he weren\u2019t quite getting enough air. \u201cYou must be Marx?

Marx helped Sam with everything while never appearing to be helping Sam at all. And so, coats miraculously materialized in plastic bags, just waiting for Sam to ask about them. And gift certificates for restaurants were always left before the holidays when Sam couldn\u2019t travel home. And when it became clear that Sam struggled to take the stairs in the dormitory they\u2019d been assigned to, and that the elevator was only intermittently functional, Marx announced his intention to live off campus.",

(The smaller bedroom had a view of the Charles.) And when Sam didn\u2019t call home often enough, it was Marx who took the time to call the Lees, back in Los Angeles. \u201cHalmeoni and Halabeoji,\u201d he\u2019d greet them in Korean. \u201cOur boy is doing fine.\u201d (Marx\u2019s father was Japanese, and his mother was Korean American.)",

He had spent his childhood among rich and supposedly interesting people, and he knew that truly unusual minds were rare. He felt that when Harvard had assigned them to be roommates, Sam had become his responsibility. So, he protected Sam, and he made the world a little easier for Sam, and it cost him next to nothing to do so.  \nMarx\u2019s life had been filled with such abundance that he was one of those people who found it natural to care for those around him.

    "165": "\u201cAre you still here?\u201d Sadie asked.  \n\u201cI am,\u201d Sam said.  \nHe took a bagel in a paper bag out of his backpack and set it on her desk, under his maze, and then he left. If he was honest with himself, it was the presence of the maze that kept him coming back. She had kept it all these years, and then taken it across the country with her, and moved it from dorm room to apartment. The next time he called home, he would tell his grandparents, Yes, you were right. Sadie had liked the gift.  \nOn the third day, he brought a library copy of the novel Galatea 2.2, which he had recently enjoyed.  \nOn the fourth day, he brought her a handheld version of the original Donkey Kong that Marx had once given him as a holiday present.  \n\u201cWhy do you keep coming?\u201d she asked.",

Click on this word, he thought, and you will find links to everything it means. Because you are my oldest friend. Because once, when I was at my lowest, you saved me. Because I might have died without you or ended up in a children\u2019s psychiatric hospital. Because I owe you. Because, selfishly, I see a future where we make fantastic games together, if you can manage to get out of bed. \u201cBecause,\u201d he repeated.  \nOn the fifth day, she wasn\u2019t in. Sam asked the roommate where she was. \u201cShe went to Medical,\u201d the roommate reported. The roommate gave Sam a hug. \u201cShe seemed a little better, though.\u201d  \n-----",

It had been many years since he had drawn a maze, but he had decided to make her a new one. He had become a better draftsman in the years since he\u2019d drawn that last one, and he wanted her to have a sample of his more recent work. The new maze would show the route from Sam\u2019s apartment, by the Charles River, to Sadie\u2019s apartment, by the Necco factory.  \nSadie got up from the bed, and she looked over Sam\u2019s shoulder, at his drawing. \u201cIt took a long time for you to get here, didn\u2019t it?\u201d  \n\u201cThe average amount of time,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cI might be out tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I start going to my classes and doing the work this week, the dean says I can still salvage the semester.\u201d",

It had been a long time since Sam had heard Sadie laugh genuinely. Many things had changed about her, but he was pleased to discover that her basic laugh was untouched, aside from an inevitable, slight change of key. She had, he thought, one of the world\u2019s great laughs. The kind of laugh where a person didn\u2019t feel that he was being laughed at. The kind of laugh that was an invitation: I cordially invite you to join in this matter that I find amusing. \u201cNo, you idiot, I want to schedule a time for us to see each other. I didn\u2019t want you to show up and not find me here.  \n-----",
    "169": "Sadie offered Sam her hand to shake. Sadie\u2019s voice was strong, but Sam thought her eyes looked vulnerable and tired. He took her hand, which was freezing and sweaty at the same time. Whatever her sickness had been, Sam could tell it had not entirely passed.  \n\u201cYou kept my maze,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cI did. Now, let\u2019s hear what you thought of Solution, \u201d Sadie said. She stood up and opened the window of her room, and the fresh air that came in was so crisp and cool, it almost felt like a drug. \u201cGo easy on me, Sammy.  \nYou may have noticed that I\u2019ve been a little depressed.\u201d  \nII  \nI N F L U E N C E S  \n1  \nIchigo, though it was not yet called Ichigo, was supposed to be easy.  \nSomething that Sam and Sadie could accomplish during the summer between their junior and senior years.",

She had been occupied with schoolwork, having fallen behind in her classes because of that dark month, the cause of which was still a mystery to Sam. The terse  \n-----",
    "171": "The other thing stopping him was how much he was enjoying having Sadie\u2019s fellowship again. The two of them had easily slipped back into the rhythms of their friendship, and they saw each other several times a week for movies, meals, games. He felt fortified in her presence. His arguments and observations were sharper. He was less aware of the brutal New England cold than he had been in the two winters he\u2019d spent without Sadie, and the constant, low-level pain in his foot was less central to his thoughts.",
    "172": "When he walked with her, he even dreaded the cobblestones less. Most of the time, Sam did not experience himself as disabled, but the cobblestones, the ice, and the glacial pace at which he had to negotiate them suggested otherwise. If it had snowed, and depending on where the class was located, Sam would sometimes have to leave for class forty-five minutes early, hobbling across campus like an emeritus professor. As he had not considered himself to be disabled, the California boy had not factored in any of this when he\u2019d decided to go to school in the Northeast.",
    "173": "Retrospectively, he realized that he had made a grave miscalculation when he had ended the friendship with Sadie. His mistake had been in thinking the world would be filled with Sadie Greens, people like her. It was not. His high school certainly hadn\u2019t been. He had held out some hope that Harvard might be, but the college had proven especially disappointing on this front. There were smart people, yes. There were people with whom you might have a decent conversation for twenty minutes. But to find someone who you wanted to talk to for 609 hours\u2014that was rare. Even Marx\u2014Marx was devoted, creative, and bright, but he was not Sadie.  \nSam decided that March was the cutoff point to convince Sadie to make a game. The high achievers who went to Harvard and MIT had usually settled their summer plans by March, if not earlier. On a personal level, Sam felt an urgency to that summer. In a year, give or take, student loans would come  \n-----",
    "174": "One of Sam\u2019s eventual strengths as an artist and as a businessman was that he knew the importance of drama, of setting the scene. He wanted to ask her to work with him at a special place\u2014the occasion of their prospective creative union should be memorable. Even then, he felt that if they made a game, and if the game became what he knew it could be, he would want there to be a story about the day Sam Masur and Sadie Green had decided to work together. He was already imagining Sam-and-Sadie lore, and he didn\u2019t even have a definitive idea for a game yet. But this was classic Sam \u2014he had learned to tolerate the sometimes-painful present by living in the future.",
    "175": "The way he saw it, he would be proposing to Sadie. He would be getting down on one knee and saying, \u201cWill you work with me? Will you give me your time, and will you trust my hunch that this time will be well spent? Will you believe that we could make great things together?\u201d For all his natural arrogance, he did not assume that she would say yes.  \nIt was Marx who suggested the Glass Flowers. Sam had asked Marx for the most interesting place at Harvard. Marx had been a Harvard Yard tour guide, but even if he hadn\u2019t been, he was the kind of well-traveled cicerone who always knew the best parts of any city.  \nThe Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants consists of around four thousand painstakingly accurate fire-blown glass and hand-painted specimens. A German father-and-son team had made them, around the turn of the nineteenth century, as a commission from the university.  \n-----",
    "176": "As Sadie described it, in a 2011 interview with the Descendants of Lovelace blog:  \nS.G.: Mazer knew I had made a couple of games at MIT, nothing much more than mini-games at that point. This one called Solution got me a little attention.  \nD.L.: That\u2019s the Holocaust one, right? It almost got you thrown out of school.",

He likes it to have drama, but honestly one person complained, it wasn\u2019t that big of a thing\u2026 But Sam\u2014sorry I know I\u2019m supposed to call Sam Mazer, but I always forget. Mazer loved Solution. Mazer felt like it was a breakthrough for me. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever make another game after Solution. I felt pretty burnt out. But toward the end of my junior year, Sam says, \u201cYou want to go to the Glass Flowers?\u201d And the truth is, I really didn\u2019t! It didn\u2019t at all sound like something I\u2019d want to do, and it\u2019s fairly inconvenient to get to the Harvard Museum of Natural History from where I was living at MIT. But I went up there, because Sam\u2014Mazer!\u2014can be a little persistent when Mazer wants something. And as you probably know, Mazer always wants something. [Laughs.]",

There\u2019s a poster out front for the Glass Flowers, and I\u2019m not the first person to make this observation, but it\u2019s fairly pointless to put up a picture of the Glass Flowers, because the models are so good, they look like actual flowers.  \nAnd I\u2019m kind of irritated, because now I\u2019ve gotten all the way here, and I\u2019m not going to see the Glass Flowers, which I didn\u2019t want to see in the first place, and I\u2019m annoyed with Sam for not calling the museum first.

I already asked.\u201d  \nFrom the time we were kids, we had always gamed together, but until he said that, I had no idea he even wanted to make games. Sam always kept things pretty close to the vest. But, well, I was at a crossroads with my own designing career, and Sam is a brilliant guy and my oldest friend, so I thought, Why not? If it works out, great. If not, I\u2019ll spend the summer with my friend. And Marx\u2019s apartment was pretty damn sweet\u2014 panoramic windows with views of the Charles, on Kennedy Street, just west of Harvard Square.  \nSo, I told him I\u2019d think about it, but I could tell he knew I was going to do it.",
    "180": "So, I told him I\u2019d think about it, but I could tell he knew I was going to do it.  \nWe walk back to town, and he looks at me seriously and he says, \u201cSadie, when you tell this story, say I asked you at the glass flower exhibit. Don\u2019t say it was closed.\u201d The myth, the narrative, whatever you want to call it, was always of supreme importance to Sam. So, I guess, by even telling this story, I\u2019m betraying him.",
    "181": "When Sadie was in her mid-thirties and what had felt like many lifetimes had passed, she would finally visit the Glass Flowers and find them unexpectedly moving. The flowers were magnificent, of course, but what struck her even more were the models the Blaschkas had made of decomposing fruits, their bruises and discolorations, in medias res, preserved for eternity. What a world, Sadie thought. People once made glass sculptures of decay, and they put these sculptures in museums. How strange and beautiful human beings are. And how fragile. An elegant older woman, who reminded her of Freda, two years gone, had been the only other person in the gallery that morning. The woman (cashmere cardigan;  \n-----",

Ichigo is sitting on the beach, by their parents\u2019 modest seaside house, in what looks like a remote fishing village. They have a shiny black bowl haircut of the kind that an Asian child of any gender might have, and they are wearing only their favorite sports jersey (number 15), which goes to their knees like a dress, and wooden flip-flops.

For Sadie, that knowledge was not necessarily helpful. Her time with Dov and her years studying games in general had made her critical of everything. She could tell you exactly what was wrong with any game, but she didn\u2019t necessarily know how to make a great game herself. There is a time for any fledgling artist where one\u2019s taste exceeds one\u2019s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anyway.

And, in a summer, with only a team of two, there were limitations to what she felt they could accomplish. They weren\u2019t trying to go for consoles, and they didn\u2019t have the resources to make a fully 3D action game like an N64-era Zelda or a Mario anyway. The game would be for PC, and it would be 2D  \nor 2\u00bdD, if she could swing it. For a long time, that was the extent of what she knew about their game.",
    "186": "In the weeks leading up to the end of the school year, Sadie and Sam brainstormed a long list of ideas on a whiteboard that Sam had stolen from the Science Center. Even with his bad foot, Sam was an accomplished thief, and he enjoyed a petty theft from time to time. He had walked into the Science Center for a goodbye meeting with Larsson. On the way out, he had seen the whiteboard unattended in a hallway, and he rolled it right out of the building, and then kept rolling it\u2014across Harvard Yard, waving at a tour of prospective students as he passed, through Harvard Square, straight down Kennedy Street, and right up into the elevator of their building. The key to being a good thief, Sam always felt, was utter brazenness. Later in the week, he stole a pack of multicolor dry-erase markers from the Harvard Coop. He slipped them into the enormous pocket of the enormous coat that Marx had given him, and he walked right out the door.",
    "187": "For a long time, nothing they wrote on the whiteboard felt essential to them. They might have never made a game before. Their office might be in Sam\u2019s rich roommate\u2019s apartment, but they were young enough to believe that whatever they made, it could very well become a classic. As Sam often said to Sadie, \u201cWhy make anything if you don\u2019t believe it could be great?\u201d  \nIt is worth noting that greatness for Sam and Sadie meant different things. To oversimplify: For Sam, greatness meant popular. For Sadie, art.  \n-----",

He grinned at Sadie.  \n\u201cYou have no right to be this happy,\u201d Sadie said.  \nWhile Sadie experienced this period of indecision as stressful, Sam didn\u2019t feel that way at all. The best part of this moment, he thought, is that everything is still possible. But then, Sam could feel that way. Sam was a decent artist and he would come to be a decent programmer and level designer, but remember, he had never made a single game before. It was Sadie who knew what it took to make a game\u2014even a bad game\u2014and it was Sadie who would do most of the heavy lifting when it came to the programming, the engine building, and everything else.",

There was another secret part of him that feared they would prefer each other to him\u2014 everyone, in Sam\u2019s estimation, loved Sadie and Marx. No one, Sam felt, had ever loved him except those who had been obligated to love him: his mother (before she had died), his grandparents, Sadie (disputed hospital volunteer), Marx (his assigned roommate). But now, with Marx lending them the apartment, Sadie and Marx would inevitably know each other.  \n-----",

He had the looks of an actor\u2014six feet tall, wide shoulders, slim waist and hips that looked elegant in clothes, strong jaw and voice, good posture and skin, a glorious pompadour of thick, black hair. If he had a complaint about his college theater career, it was that he was always being cast as wooden strongmen or priggish dukes. In life, Marx wasn\u2019t at all wooden or priggish. He was quick to laugh, warm and energetic, verging on goofy, and so it was strange to him that he was cast this way, that people saw him this way. He wondered what it was about himself. At a cast party for Hamlet, having smoked a couple of joints, he once asked a director friend, \u201cWhat is it about me? Why am I a Laertes and not a Hamlet?\u201d  \nThe friend had seemed uncomfortable when Marx had posed the question. \u201cIt\u2019s your quality,\u201d he had said.  \n\u201cWhat about my quality?\u201d Marx had insisted.",

It was clarifying to him. The inscrutable, inaccessible, mysterious, exotic thing about him was\u2014 duh\u2014his Asianness, and it was permanent.  \nAnd even in college theater, there were only so many parts that an Asian actor could play.",

At his mother\u2019s insistence, he\u2019d gone to an international school in Tokyo, with kids from all over the world in it. It had sheltered him, for the most part, from the racism in his own country. Still, he was aware of a certain amount of racism that the Japanese felt against Koreans, in particular, and foreigners, in general. For example, his Korean American mother, who had taught textile design at Tokyo University, had made very few friends in all the years they had lived in Tokyo\u2014but he could not say whether that was the result of xenophobia, his mother\u2019s reserved nature, or her imperfect Japanese. But because he had been mostly raised in Asia, he had been completely sheltered from the kind of racism that Asians experienced in America. Until Harvard, he had not realized that in America \u2014and not just in its college theaters\u2014there were only so many roles an Asian could play.",

It wasn\u2019t so much being on stage that he loved, but the productions themselves. He loved the intimacy of being in a tight group of people who had come together, miraculously, for a brief period in time, for the purpose of making art. He mourned every time a production was over, and he rejoiced when he was cast in a new one. The brief seasons of his college life were marked by the plays in which he performed. Freshman year: Macbeth, The Marriage of Bette and Boo. Sophomore year: The Mikado, Hamlet.  \n-----",

Undulating layers of programmed laser light and smoke; the sounds of waves crashing, thunder, and rain; and even a gentle misting of cold water that made the audience gasp and applaud like delighted children.

Around the time of Marx\u2019s birth, Watanabe-san, a Princeton-educated economist, had left the academic world to get rich. He had succeeded. His portfolio included a chain of convenience stores, a medium-sized cell phone company, and a variety of other international investments. He told them he regretted that he had missed an early opportunity to invest in Nintendo in the 1970s. \u201cThey were just a playing-card company,\u201d Watanabe-san said, with a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cHanafuda. For aunties and little children, you know?\u201d  \nNintendo\u2019s most successful product before they made Donkey Kong was, indeed, a deck of hanafuda playing cards.  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s hanafuda?\u201d Sam asked.  \n-----",

She was still thinking about Marx and the producer credit, so she didn\u2019t even know what she was saying yes to. She decided to change the subject.

I\u2019m not a city boy. I was born in a small town on the west coast of Japan, and every year, we waited for the great rains, which always came in the summer. As a child, my greatest fear was that I, or my father, who owned a small fleet of fishing boats, would be washed away to sea.\u201d  \nSadie nodded and exchanged a look with Sam.  \n\u201cWhat conspiracy is this?\u201d Watanabe-san said, smiling.  \n-----",

Once she said it, she knew she would have to do it. \u201cAnd the rest of the game is how the child gets back home.\u201d  \n\u201cYes.\u201d Watanabe-san nodded. \u201cThis is a classic story.\u201d  \nWhen Sam had described the relationship between Marx and his father, he had said it was fraught, that Watanabe-san was demanding and sometimes even demeaning to Marx.

She found Marx\u2019s father to be bright, interesting, and engaged.  \nOther people\u2019s parents are often a delight.  \n\u2014  \nThe next day, Sam helped Sadie pack. To save money, Sadie would live in Marx\u2019s room and sublet her apartment. \u201cAre you going to put the art in storage?\u201d Sam asked.

    "206": "Sadie stopped packing and stood in front of the Hokusai wave, hands on her hips. In the three hours since they\u2019d been at it, Sam had come to realize that, while she was a wonderful person, she was a terrible packer.  \nEach decision required extensive deliberation\u2014which clothes? Which cords? Which computer hardware? It had taken ninety minutes to go through her relatively small bookshelf: Did Sam think she would finally have time to read Chaos this summer? Did Sam want to read it? Oh, he had already read it. Well then, she should probably take it, unless he had a copy, in which case she could read his and store hers. And then she would pick up A Brief History of Time, and fondly pat its cover. Maybe I\u2019ll read it again this summer? And then, Hackers. Have you read this, Sam? It\u2019s so good.  \nHackers has a whole section on the Williamses. You know, Sierra games?  \n-----",

(In Japanese, the title is far more ominous, something like, Under the Wave off Kanagawa.) The Great Wave is arguably the most famous Japanese artwork in the world, and in the 1990s, it was absolutely an MIT student housing staple, only slightly less ubiquitous than those Magic Eye prints that always left Sam so cold. The Great Wave depicts an enormous wave that dwarfs the other elements in the frame, three fishing boats and a mountain. The style is clean and graphic, befitting the fact that it was designed to be carved into a cherrywood block and infinitely reproduced.",
    "209": "Sadie knew that the key to making a video game on limited resources was to make the limitations part of the style. (That was why she had made Solution black-and-white.) For the same reason that the print would have been reproducible in the 1830s (its limited palette and the deceptive simplicity of its form language), Sadie knew she would be able to re-create this look in computer graphics as well.  \nSam considered the Hokusai wave. He backed up, cleaned his glasses, and then considered it some more. \u201cI see it,\u201d he said. They were at that rare moment in a collaboration where they were consistently grokking, where consensus was reached quickly on almost everything. \u201cIs the child Japanese like Marx\u2019s father?\u201d  \n-----",

They can\u2019t speak much or read. Their own language is a foreign language. So, the gamer won\u2019t know anyway.\u201d  \nThe decision to style the world after the Hokusai pushed everything in a Japanese direction, though. And as they were coming up with the character design for their \u201cchild,\u201d they found themselves drawn to Japanese references over and over: the deceptively innocent paintings of Yoshitomo Nara; Miyazaki anime like Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service and Princess Mononoke; other, more adult anime like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, both of which Sam had loved; and of course, Hokusai\u2019s Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji series, the first of which is The Great Wave.",
    "211": "It was 1996, and the word \u201cappropriation\u201d never occurred to either of them. They were drawn to these references because they loved them, and they found them inspiring. They weren\u2019t trying to steal from another culture, though that is probably what they did.  \nConsider Mazer in a 2017 interview with Kotaku, celebrating the twentieth- anniversary Nintendo Switch port of the original Ichigo: KOTAKU: It is said that the original Ichigo is one of the most graphically beautiful low- budget games ever made, but its critics also accuse it of appropriation. How do you respond to that?  \nMAZER: I do not respond to that.  \nKOTAKU: Okay\u2026But would you make the same game if you were making it now?  \nMAZER: No, because I am a different person than I was then.",

Ichigo looks like a character Yoshitomo Nara could have painted. The world design looks like Hokusai, except for the Undead level, which looks like Murakami. The soundtrack sounds like Toshiro Mayuzumi\u2026  \n-----",
    "213": "KOTAKU: I don\u2019t know.  \nMAZER: The alternative to appropriation is a world in which artists only reference their own cultures.  \nKOTAKU: That\u2019s an oversimplification of the issue.  \nMAZER: The alternative to appropriation is a world where white European people make art about white European people, with only white European references in it. Swap African or Asian or Latin or whatever culture you want for European. A world where everyone is blind and deaf to any culture or experience that is not their own. I hate that world, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m terrified of that world, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world, and as a mixed-race person, I literally don\u2019t exist in it. My dad, who I barely knew, was Jewish. My mom was an American-born Korean. I was raised by Korean immigrant grandparents in Koreatown, Los Angeles. And as any mixed-race person will tell you\u2014to be half of two things is to be whole of nothing.",

But if Ichigo had been fucking Korean, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for you, I guess?  \n\u2014  \nSam and his mother, Anna Lee, arrived in Los Angeles in July of 1984. It was the summer of the Olympics, the first Summer Olympics to be held in the United States in fifty years. The mood was hopeful and manic. Los Angeles, especially when taken from a distance, was not a beautiful city, but she could will herself to be beautiful, if only for two weeks. Beauty, after all, is almost always a matter of angles and resolve. Urban renewal projects were accomplished so frantically it seemed like time-lapse  \n-----",

Anna had told Sam about K-town, but he had no sense of how large K-town would actually be. He thought it would be like Chinatown in New York, a couple of blocks of apothecaries, gift shops, and restaurants, or like Thirty- Second Street, Manhattan\u2019s Korean restaurant row, where he and his mom would sometimes go after a show for bulgogi and banchan. K-town in Los Angeles was massive. It was miles and miles of Korean people and things, right in the center of town.

As Sadie would put it in an interview with Wired, \u201cThe game character, like the self, is contextual.\u201d In Koreatown, no one ever thought Sam was Korean. In Manhattan, no one had ever thought he was white. In Los Angeles, he was the \u201cwhite cousin.\u201d In New York, he was that \u201clittle Chinese kid.\u201d And yet, in K-town, he felt more Korean than he ever had before. Or to put a finer point on it, he felt more aware of the fact that he was a Korean and that that was not necessarily a negative or even a neutral fact about him. The awareness gave him pause: perhaps a funny-looking mixed-race kid could exist at the center of the world, not just on its periphery.",

All of these issues weighed pleasurably on the family.  \nHis mother was treated like a celebrity. She was the Korean girl who had made it among white people. She had been in A Chorus Line.

You\u2019ll see,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHe\u2019s a resource, if we choose to employ him that way.\u201d  \nAs the matter had already been decided, Sadie went back to work.  \nThey had made a great deal of progress on the design of their still nameless child. Sam had come up with the child\u2019s wardrobe: the father\u2019s sports jersey worn long, like a dress; the wooden flip-flops. They had settled on the slick bowl haircut, which they both liked aesthetically and practically. A helmet- like hairstyle would have the cleanest look when layered into the complicated Hokusai-inspired backgrounds.",

She wanted the walk to feel buoyant and slightly out of control, like a baby duck trailing after its mother. In the design document that she and Sam had written: \u201cThe child\u2019s body moves the way a body can move before it has felt or even encountered the idea of pain.\u201d Oh, the ambitions of design documents!  \nSadie devoted several days to the problem of the child\u2019s walk. She gave the character a tiny stride length, with fast steps that would leave bird-like, fading footprints. This was better, but what finally cracked it for her was to make the child not just move linearly, but to always have a few awkward accelerating steps to the side even when the player was piloting the character forward.  \nShe showed her work to Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Sam said. He moved the child around the screen. \u201cBut that\u2019s me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I walk.\u201d  \n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Sadie said.  \n-----",

Distantly, they could see fireworks. They had both forgotten it was the Fourth of July.  \nWhen Marx arrived in town, they showed him a demo of the first level.  \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t at all finished,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cThere\u2019s no lighting or sound, but it\u2019ll give you a sense of the look we\u2019re going for, and what the basic gameplay will feel like.

He wasn\u2019t an ace programmer, like Sadie, and he couldn\u2019t draw, like Sam. But he did almost everything else for them, and his contributions ranged from the pedestrian, but necessary, to the creatively essential. Marx organized workflow, so Sadie and Sam were more aware of what the other was doing and what they needed to be doing. He made long lists of supplies they would need. He was more than liberal with his credit card\u2014they always needed more memory and storage, and they were regularly burning out graphics cards\u2014and he must have made fifty trips to the large computer store in Central Square that summer. He opened a bank account, and an LLC, Go, Ichigo, Go.

How do we communicate in a world when we don\u2019t have language? This story compelled Marx, in part, because his mother had never fully spoken Japanese, and he believed that was why she had spent most of her adult life lonely and sometimes depressed.

In a way, Marx found producing for Sadie and Sam to be not entirely different from just being Sam\u2019s roommate. Without calling a great deal of attention to himself, he made things easy for them. He fought fires. He anticipated needs and obstacles before they arose.

A week before Thanksgiving, Sam had passed out while walking to the Coop to buy a new power six-pack. Usually, Marx did their purchasing, but Marx was in class, and Sam could not wait. He literally passed out on the street, in front of the gourmet shop. With his big coat, people must have assumed he was homeless, and so he was barely noticed. When he awoke, his former adviser, Anders Larsson, was standing over him, looking like a blond Jesus in North Face. It made sense that Anders should find him.

As Sam would often tease him, \u201cMarx never met a genius he didn\u2019t want to sleep with.\u201d A decade later, Zoe would win a Pulitzer Prize for an operatic adaptation of Antigone she had written using only female voices.

It was interesting to note the way your body had changed and how their body had changed in the time since you\u2019d last been intimate. There was a pleasant Weltschmerz that came over him. It was the nostalgia one experienced when visiting an old school and finding that the desks were so much smaller than in one\u2019s memory.  \n\u201cWhy did we ever break up?\u201d Zoe asked.  \n\u201cYou broke up with me, remember?\u201d Marx said.  \n\u201cDid I?

The reasons for this are simple: branding, and it is much less work. But Sadie and Sam wanted Ichigo\u2019s journey to be reflected in their character. Ichigo ages and takes the damage inflicted by the narrative and time itself, and by the end of the story, when they finally make it home, after about seven years away, they are unrecognizable to their family. Ichigo returns home an exhausted, weary ten-year-old who has battled the ocean, the city, the tundra, and even the underworld.

She imagined palm trees and warm weather and the scent of plumeria, and their ill-fitting, puffy coats unceremoniously tossed in garbage bags for donation to the Salvation Army.

He had never seen anything die before and so, he could not be certain that she was dying.  \nAnd yet, somewhere deep inside himself, he felt a recognition and then a reckoning: this was death, and he would die, and his mother would die, and everyone you ever met and ever loved would die, and maybe it would happen when you or they were old, but maybe not.

Help is coming,\u201d Anna tried to reassure her. \u201cI\u2019m Anna, by the way. I\u2019ll stay with you until the ambulance gets here.\u201d Anna took the woman\u2019s hand.  \n\u201cI\u2019m Anna, too,\u201d the woman said.  \n\u201cI\u2019m Anna Lee,\u201d Anna said.",

The woman inhaled raggedly and coughed in a peculiar, delicate way. Anna was certain the woman\u2019s neck was broken. Copious amounts of blood were flowing from some hole or series of holes in the woman\u2019s body, but Anna could not see an obvious way to stop the bleeding. Anna was getting blood on her white tennis shoes, which she was fastidious about keeping white. And the other Anna Lee was getting blood everywhere, but noticeably, to Anna, on the large, floppy, pink lace bow she wore, Madonna-style, in her shiny black hair.  \n\u201cOh, that makes sense,\u201d Anna said lightly. \u201cThere\u2019re a lot of us. Isn\u2019t Lee the most popular Asian surname in the world? In my union, I had to change my name to Anna Q. Lee, because you can\u2019t have more than one person with the same name. I\u2019m the seventh Anna Lee in Equity.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s Equity?\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s the stage actor\u2019s union.\u201d  \n-----",
    "296": "\u201cWell,\u201d Anna said. \u201cI\u2019ve played almost every Asian part an actress can play, but my biggest role was Connie Wong in A Chorus Line.\u201d  \n\u201cI saw that the year it opened,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou were good.\u201d  \n\u201cI was the third Connie Wong on Broadway, and I was the second Connie Wong in the national touring company, too. So, you didn\u2019t see me.  \nYou probably saw Baayork Lee.

She tried to shrug, but then her body began to spasm, and ninety long seconds later, she died. Anna stood up. She stood over the other Anna Lee\u2019s body and began to feel giddily, vertiginously untethered from her own body. She felt as if she were seeing herself dead on that sidewalk. She knew she should stay with the other Anna\u2019s body until the ambulance got there, but it was frigid, and she feared spending more time with the other Anna would provoke some irreversible existential crisis, and she desperately wanted to be with Sam.  \nShe went into the bodega to find her son. She quickly scanned the aisles, but she couldn\u2019t find him anywhere.  \n\u201cDid my son come in here?\u201d Anna said. She tried to ignore the paranoid fantasy that was forming in her mind: What if the other Anna Lee\u2019s death had merely been a distraction so that some evil party could kidnap Sam?  \n-----",
    "298": "\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave, did he?\u201d  \n\u201cNo, but he was quite distraught, so I gave him quarters to play the machine in the back of my store. Children love games, though the machine doesn\u2019t make as much money for me as it once did.\u201d  \n\u201cThat was very kind of you,\u201d Anna said. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d  \nThe man waved his hand. \u201cPlease. It is hard enough to be a child in this world without women throwing themselves from buildings. How is she?\u201d  \nAnna shook her head.  \n\u201cWhat a world,\u201d the shopkeeper said, shaking his head, too.  \nShe walked to the back of the store, where Sam was concealed by the mammoth, cheerful shell of the Ms. Pac-Man machine. From what Anna could tell, Ms. Pac-Man was no different than Pac-Man, except that she had a bow and was a Ms., which in 1984 was an honorific that usually signified a feminist.  \n\u201cHi,\u201d Anna said.  \n\u201cHi,\u201d Sam said, without looking at her. \u201cYou can watch if you want.  \nI\u2019m going to play until the end of this life.\u201d",

She concentrated on the game and tried not to hear the nearby sirens that meant the ambulance had come for the body of the other Anna Lee.  \n\u201cIf you eat the fruit,\u201d Sam said, \u201cyou can kill the ghosts, but only for a little while. And if you don\u2019t time it right, the ghosts can turn back and kill you.\u201d  \n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Anna said.

They\u2019re taking her to the hospital.\u201d  \n\u201cWill she be okay?\u201d Sam said.  \n\u201cI think so,\u201d Anna said. It wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. She would be okay.  \nDead was okay.  \nSam nodded, but he had seen Anna in enough plays to know when she was lying, and he knew her well enough to know why she lied. When he lied, it was for the same reason: to protect her from that which she could not handle. \u201cWhy did she do that?\u201d Sam asked.  \n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Anna said. \u201cI think she must have been terribly blue.

Maybe shopping for the new drive they had discussed needing?  \nMaybe a pilgrimage to see the Glass Flowers? Maybe lunch with Anders?  \nMaybe he\u2019d finally been arrested for shoplifting?  \nThey\u2019d been at this for a while when Marx noticed the whiteboard.  \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing on it,\u201d he remarked.  \n-----",

    "307": "And when she didn\u2019t find him in those places, she did the Central Square ones: the comic book store, the computer store, her old apartment, the Indian place. She went back to Harvard Square, walking up toward the Radcliffe Quad, to the university police station, and finally, defeated, she went to University Health. She didn\u2019t even have a photograph of Sam to show, so she kept having to describe him. Enormous coat, badly cut curly hair, glasses, limp. A collection of flaws and infirmities. She was glad Sam didn\u2019t have to hear her. No one had been seen who matched that description anyway. She walked back through Harvard Yard, calling out his name until her voice was ragged. A woman stopped her, and asked, \u201cWhat does the dog look like? I\u2019ll keep an eye out.\u201d She retraced the same route she and Sam had taken just that morning when the world seemed soft-focused and filled with possibility. The path now seemed dismal and dangerous to her.",
    "308": "And she thought to herself that it was strange how quickly the world could shift. She let her mind go to the dark place. What if Sam had been kidnapped or beaten? He was small and slow, and he would be easy to overpower. What if Sam were dead? She didn\u2019t truly believe that he was dead, but what if he was? She couldn\u2019t entirely articulate who he was to her.  \n-----",

We lived together for two years before I knew he\u2019d been in a car accident. For years, I had no idea what was wrong with him. It could have been anything. I\u2019d hint around it, and I\u2019d notice him struggling and I\u2019d do what I could to help, not that he\u2019d ever ask for any. But I was curious, so I\u2019d give him openings to talk. A normal person would probably have some desire to, like, explain to the person they lived with what was going on with them, but not Sam. Sam loves his secrets. My point is, I\u2019m worried, but I\u2019m not that worried.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat made him finally tell you about the car accident?\u201d Sadie asked.  \n\u201cHe never told me.

Because people\u2014critics, gamers, the Opus marketing department\u2014could more easily find Sam in the game, Ichigo became Sam\u2019s creation, not Sadie\u2019s, and as such, he became the game\u2019s auteur.

Sadie was twenty- two when Ichigo was launched, and she hadn\u2019t figured out who she was in public yet. (She barely knew who she was in private.) There were so few prominent female game designers, and there wasn\u2019t exactly a playbook for how a female game designer was supposed to present herself. But the fact is, no one at Opus was pushing Sadie to put herself forward either. The men at Opus wanted Sam to be the face of Ichigo, and so he was. The gaming industry, like many industries, loves its wonder boys.",
    "356": "Still, Sadie had to concede, if only to herself: it wasn\u2019t only that Sam liked promotion; he was better at it than she was. Before the game\u2019s launch, they had done a joint appearance at a sales conference in Boca Raton. It had been the biggest crowd they had ever spoken to, around five hundred people. Sam had been nervous, but Sadie hadn\u2019t been nervous at all. He had paced around the makeshift greenroom up until the moment they were called on stage.  \n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d Sam had said.  \n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Sadie had squeezed his hand and poured him a glass of water. \u201cIt\u2019s a hotel ballroom and a couple of hundred nerds.\u201d  \n\u201cI don\u2019t like so many eyes on me,\u201d Sam had said. He raked his fingers through his hair, which had become a Jewfro in the Florida humidity.  \nBut as soon as they got on the dais, Sam\u2019s nerves disappeared, and he transformed into the world\u2019s most entertaining talk-show guest. When Sadie  \n-----",
    "357": "When Sam was asked a question, he turned it into a novella. The story could go on for fifteen minutes and take an extended detour into childhood without anyone ever seeming the slightest bit bored. \u201cOn the day I met Sadie, I hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone for six weeks, literally six weeks. But that\u2019s a whole other story. I\u2019ll tell you some other time when we\u2019re better friends. But the main thing you need to know is, Sadie couldn\u2019t get Mario on top of the flagpole.

You couldn\u2019t just cheat.  \nYou had to know someone who knew\u2026\u201d The crowd leaned forward when he spoke, laughed at his jokes, spontaneously broke into applause. They loved him. He was more handsome in front of a crowd; his limp, less apparent; his voice, warm and authoritative. It was as if all these years Sam had been waiting for an audience. Sadie marveled at his transformation.  \nWhere had her introverted partner gone? Who was this raconteur? Who was this clown?",
    "358": "Where had her introverted partner gone? Who was this raconteur? Who was this clown?  \nAnd next to him, Sadie felt herself diminish.  \n3  \nIchigo II: Go, Ichigo, Go came out in November 1998, almost a year after Ichigo: A Child of the Sea. In the second game, Ichigo\u2019s little sister, Hanami, is lost in yet another storm, and Ichigo, now age eleven, must find her. The second game sold modestly better than the first, but it was largely seen to be coasting on the original\u2019s reputation and strong sales. Most critics, including Sadie and Sam, thought the game was creatively a step backward. It wasn\u2019t that the second Ichigo was a bad game, but what it felt like was more of the same. Ichigo II didn\u2019t take the Ichigo character in a new direction; it didn\u2019t push things graphically, technically, or story-wise.",

You\u2019re going to the doctor right now,\u201d Marx said.  \n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m supposed to meet with Sadie in a couple of hours,\u201d Sam said calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a new game. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to bleed to death tonight. Trust me, Marx. I\u2019ve been dealing with this sort of thing for a while. Would you mind getting me some cotton and gauze?\u201d",
    "387": "-----",
    "388": "\u201cIt\u2019ll heal in a couple of days. It always does,\u201d Sam said, with a confidence that he did not entirely feel. \u201cSadie and I are starting to get momentum with the new game.\u201d  \nAfter last night\u2019s argument, Marx was encouraged to hear that they were working on something and curious to hear what it was. \u201cFine,\u201d Marx said. \u201cBut I\u2019m making you an appointment for tomorrow.\u201d  \nSam\u2019s orthopedist was booked for the next week. By the morning of his appointment, the foot seemed neither better nor worse, though Sam was not walking on it almost at all, and he had, in the last several days, developed a fever. Marx went with Sam to the doctor, both to ensure that he went, and to offer his assistance on the way back.",
    "389": "At the doctor\u2019s office, Marx waited in the reception area and passed the time reading Joan Didion\u2019s White Album, which was not entirely pleasure reading. Zoe was thinking of moving to California. She had begun to find work scoring films, television, and advertising, and she thought she could find more work if she moved out to Los Angeles for a time. The idea appealed to Marx, not just for Zoe, but because he had always been drawn to living in California. He loved the West Coast. He had wanted to go to Stanford, but he hadn\u2019t gotten in. He appreciated Los Angeles, its skinny palm trees and its decaying Spanish-style homes and its occasional flocks of parrots and its smiling people who always wanted something from you. He liked hiking and running, and he wouldn\u2019t have minded living in a place where he could be outdoors most of the year. In terms of work, there were tons of game people on the West Coast, particularly in Los Angeles, and airy, stylish, modern office spaces that cost less",
    "390": "where he could be outdoors most of the year. In terms of work, there were tons of game people on the West Coast, particularly in Los Angeles, and airy, stylish, modern office spaces that cost less than what they paid in Cambridge. After he\u2019d returned from a business trip out there the prior year, Marx had floated the idea of setting up their office in California to Sadie and Sam. They were both from Los Angeles and neither had wanted to return. To return to the city of one\u2019s birth always felt like retreat.",
    "391": "About a half hour after he\u2019d gone in, Sam emerged from the doctor\u2019s office. He was on crutches, his foot was wrapped in thick bandages, and he was carrying a prescription that needed to be filled for a course of antibiotics.  \n-----",
    "392": "Sam shrugged. \u201cNothing I didn\u2019t already know.\u201d  \n\u201cSo, you\u2019re good?\u201d Marx persisted. He could not get the visual of Sam\u2019s foot out of his mind.  \n\u201cI\u2019m the same as I\u2019ve always been,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI want to get back to work.\u201d  \nMarx and Sam went out to the parking lot to wait for a cab. Marx pretended to realize he had left The White Album in the waiting area. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a second,\u201d he said.  \nBack in the office, he quickly claimed his book and then he went up to the desk to see if Sam\u2019s doctor had a moment to speak with him. He was Sam\u2019s brother, he said, and he had questions about Sam\u2019s condition.  \nBecause Marx was Marx\u2014handsome, charming, polite\u2014the nurse said she would try.",
    "393": "Because Marx was Marx\u2014handsome, charming, polite\u2014the nurse said she would try.  \nMarx went back to the doctor\u2019s office, and the doctor said she was quite glad to talk to him, because she wasn\u2019t always sure Sam was hearing her. She had cleaned, stitched up the wound, and realigned the foot as much as it was possible to do so. The largest wound on his foot had become infected, so Sam had to be given a course of antibiotics. But the news was not good. The doctor felt an amputation was inevitable.",
    "394": "\u201cHe says he can tolerate the pain, though I don\u2019t know how he is. But it isn\u2019t about the pain at this point. His foot is unsustainable. The rods are wearing out what\u2019s left of his bone and his skin is becoming prone to infection and resistant to healing. The only way to stop the damage is if he uses a wheelchair and puts literally no pressure on the foot, which I wouldn\u2019t recommend for an active twenty-four-year-old. He will constantly be back here unless he takes serious action. The sooner, the better. He doesn\u2019t want to end up with sepsis, which could lead to a riskier emergency amputation. He\u2019s young and he\u2019s in good health\u2014if it were my brother, I\u2019d tell him it\u2019s time.\u201d  \n-----",
    "395": "\u201cThat took a while,\u201d Sam remarked.  \n\u201cYes.\u201d  \n\u201cWell,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI can tell by your face and your dodgy timeline that something happened in there. What is it?\u201d  \n\u201cI ran into your doctor when I was in the lobby. She thought I was your brother. She seems\u201d\u2014Marx searched for the right word\u2014\u201cconcerned.\u201d  \nSam tightened his grip on his crutches. \u201cShe had no right to talk to you.  \nMy medical situation is my private business.\u201d  \nMarx knew that invoking friendship and personal history was never useful with Sam. \u201cSam, it arguably is my business. We\u2019re partners, and if you\u2019re going to need major surgery, Sadie and I need to be able to plan.\u201d  \n\u201cPeople have been telling me that I have to do something about this foot for years. I get it. I get that it\u2019s probably close to time, but I need to make the new game with Sadie first.\u201d",
    "396": "\u201cPeople have been telling me that I have to do something about this foot for years. I get it. I get that it\u2019s probably close to time, but I need to make the new game with Sadie first.\u201d  \n\u201cSam! How long is that going to take? You haven\u2019t even started. I\u2019m your producer and I don\u2019t know anything about it. A week ago, you two were still arguing about whether to make Ichigo III.\u201d  \n\u201cWe\u2019ve resolved that now.\u201d  \n\u201cThis is madness. If you\u2019re scared, that would be entirely understandable. That would be\u2014\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m not scared. I simply can\u2019t make the game and be recovering from having an amputation at the same time,\u201d Sam said imperiously. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for surgery and physical therapy and getting a prosthetic that fits.  \nIt\u2019s winter in Massachusetts, Marx. It\u2019s hard enough for me to get around as it is.\u201d  \n-----",
    "397": "\u201cAnd I\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t mention any of this to Sadie,\u201d Sam said when the cab arrived at Kennedy Street.  \nMarx nodded. He got out first, so he could help Sam out of the cab.  \n\u2014  \nMarx went to Zoe\u2019s apartment that night and he relayed what had happened with Sam. Zoe was sitting in the living room, cross-legged on an ikat- patterned cushion and playing the pan flute, which she was currently learning. Her Titian hair fell past her breasts and she wore only underwear.  \nZoe always kept the heat turned up in her apartment so that she could wear as little clothing as possible. She liked feeling the vibrations of her instruments, she said. She liked feeling the vibrations of the earth underneath her and the air around her. There was a secret music, she claimed, that she could only hear when there was nothing between her and the universe. (By \u201cnothing,\u201d she meant \u201cclothing.\u201d) Zoe joked\u2014or maybe it wasn\u2019t a joke\u2014that her first sexual experience had been with her cello.  \n-----",
    "398": "\u201cThe solution is completely obvious,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cYou have to convince Sam and Sadie to go to California with us. The winter won\u2019t be a problem in California. Everyone drives out there, so Sam won\u2019t have to walk as much, and his recovery will be easier.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to California yet,\u201d Marx said.  \n\u201cOh, you are,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cI know it. Marx, look at you. You were meant for California. Unfair is between games, and Sam needs time off, so it\u2019s the perfect time to move your office to California, which you\u2019ve told me for years is what you want to do. Sam will have plenty of time to have the surgery and recover, while you and Sadie set up the office and start hiring.\u201d  \nZoe clapped her hands together. \u201cDone.\u201d  \n\u201cSadie might not want to go,\u201d Marx said. \u201cDov is here.\u201d  \nZoe rolled her eyes. \u201cMarx, Sadie is dying to have an excuse to leave Dov.\u201d  \n\u201cShe loves Dov,\u201d Marx said.  \n\u201cShe hates Dov. He will never get divorced. We all know this,\u201d Zoe said.",

We all know this,\u201d Zoe said.  \nMarx laughed at Zoe\u2019s certainty\u2014he had known Sadie for three years, half as long as he\u2019d known Sam, and he still found her to be a mystery. \u201cSo how do I convince Sam?\u201d Marx asked.  \n\u201cMarx, my love, you are so innocent. You don\u2019t have to convince anyone. You tell Sadie that Sam needs to go to California\u2014his foot is rotting; he  \n-----",
    "400": "You tell Sam that Sadie needs to go\u2014she needs to find a way to break with Dov. Those two are thick as thieves; they\u2019ll do anything for each other.\u201d  \nMarx kissed Zoe on the lips. She tasted like cinnamon tea and mandarin oranges, and he wanted to have sex with her, but he could tell she was still in the middle of work. \u201cYou\u2019re being very Lady Macbeth tonight.  \nAre you saying all these things because you want me to go to California with you?\u201d  \n\u201cWell, yes, partially. But it\u2019s also the absolute correct course of action,\u201d  \nZoe said.  \n\u2014",

He went to Sadie first and, ignoring Sam\u2019s prohibition against it, conveyed the information about Sam\u2019s disturbingly decrepit foot. Sadie said that she had not seen herself in California, but she readily agreed that it made sense for Sam and for the company. It was evident to her\u2014as it would have been to anyone close to Sam\u2014that something needed to be done about Sam\u2019s health, and all of that would be easier for him in California. \u201cTo tell you the truth,\u201d Sadie said, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired of winter myself.\u201d",
    "402": "When Marx went to Sam, he diverged from Zoe\u2019s advice. He began with the argument about the state-of-the-art office they could build in L.A., and the inspiring L.A. gaming scene, and he did not mention anything about Sadie. Sam had told Marx about Both Sides\u2014Marx loved the idea, but then, no one truly cared about Marx\u2019s opinion of what they should do next.  \nHowever, Both Sides, and its ambitious scale, fed perfectly into Marx\u2019s argument. They would require a larger office to accommodate the staff they would need to make it. Sam still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt\u2019ll take time to move and to hire decent people and to set up the office,\u201d Sam argued.  \n-----",
    "403": "Sam shook his head. \u201cSadie\u2019s willing to do this? She\u2019s willing to leave Dov?\u201d  \n\u201cShe is,\u201d Marx said. \u201cI think she wants to even, but she doesn\u2019t know how. It might help her if she had a reason to go.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Sadie.\u201d  \nZoe was not the only one who had observed that all was not right between Sadie and Dov.  \nIn addition to the divorce that never happened, Sadie sometimes showed up to the office with light bruising on her face and limbs, rope burns, small scratches; on one occasion, a sprained wrist. A series of minor injuries, nothing that serious or even noticeable, but enough so that Marx had once seen fit to ask her what the story was.",
    "404": "Marx and Sadie had gone to Austin by themselves to meet with the Opus team. The weather in Austin was murderously hot, so when they got back to their hotel, the two of them had changed into swimsuits and gone to the pool. Marx couldn\u2019t help but notice the number of bruises on Sadie\u2019s legs and arms, and later that night when they were sitting in the hotel bar, he, very gently, asked her about them. They were having hard, grown-up drinks \u2014an old-fashioned for Marx and a whiskey sour for Sadie. It was kind of a joke, a play on being sad, middle-aged adults on a business trip.  \nMarx lightly touched the welt on her wrist. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.  \nSadie had laughed in that low breathy way she had when she was embarrassed. She covered the wrist with her other hand. Marx thought she wasn\u2019t going to tell him anything, but then she did.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a game we like to play,\u201d she said.  \n\u201cA game?\u201d Marx said.  \n-----",
    "405": "\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.  \nSadie considered the question. She took another swig of her drink.  \n\u201cSometimes.\u201d She smiled her crooked smile, and there was an apologetic look in her eyes, as if she knew she had betrayed Dov by admitting that she only sometimes enjoyed sex with him. \u201cBut he\u2019s great. I mean, he\u2019s been really great for me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for all of us, too.\u201d  \n5  \nIt is relatively easy to pack up your life when you\u2019re twenty-three, and Sadie was significantly finished by the time Dov returned from the break.  \n\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d he said.  \n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026Well, I\u2019m going to California,\u201d she said.",

Sam had already gotten a referral for a new team of doctors. He had left before Christmas so that he could get the surgery scheduled. Once he\u2019d committed to this course of action, he said he wanted it done as soon as possible. New Year\u2019s Day, Marx and Zoe flew out to L.A. to find office space for the company, and an apartment for the two of them. They found both in Venice, where Marx determined the cool kids in tech were. Sam and Sadie didn\u2019t need apartments yet\u2014Sam would stay with his grandparents until after he\u2019d recovered from the surgery, and Sadie would stay with her parents and could house hunt from there.  \nDov listened quietly until she was done. He was silent a moment before he said, \u201cLike thieves in the bloody night. When were you planning to tell me?\u201d  \n\u201cIt happened fast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t personal.\u201d",

    "408": "Dov sat on the bed and watched Sadie empty the bureau. He squinted, as if it were a problem with his eyes. He put his head in his hands.  \n\u201cDo you want me to ask you to marry me? Is that what you want?\u201d  \n\u201cNo,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cYou can\u2019t anyway.\u201d  \n\u201cDo you want me to get a divorce right now?

Sometimes, it had aroused her, and sometimes, it had annoyed her, and sometimes, it had frightened her. This time, Sadie felt nothing. She didn\u2019t fight him. She let it happen. He reached under her skirt, between her legs, and he yanked her underwear off, and then he threw it across the room. He wouldn\u2019t have sex without her consent, but he felt free to make her uncomfortable and embarrassed. He slammed the door to the bedroom, and she could hear him smacking something\u2014the wall? the sofa?\u2014in the other room. She picked up the phone with her free hand, and she called Sam.

Your parents must be so excited,\u201d Bong Cha said. She was clearly delighted to have Sam home.  \n\u201cThey are,\u201d Sadie said.  \n\u201cIchigo is everywhere. Did you know there was a billboard on Sunset?  \nDid Sam show you the pictures we took?\u201d  \n\u201cHe did,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cThanks so much.\u201d  \n\u201cOh, it\u2019s no bother. Dong Hyun is so proud of you two. He tells everyone how Sam and his childhood friend made this big game all by themselves.

On this morning, Dov\u2019s driving was subdued, but he decided to pass the time lecturing Sadie about the folly of her exodus from Boston. He expressed his concerns through a series of histrionic rhetorical questions concerning L.A.\u2019s shortcomings, all of which Sadie, a native Angeleno, already knew: Did she know about the earthquakes? The fires? The floods?  \nThe drought? The smog? The homeless? The coyotes? The general sense of looming apocalypse? Did she know that drugstores closed at ten?

And the traffic, Hashem, had she heard about the traffic? Was she prepared to spend the majority of her waking hours en route?

He had become practiced at sensing the signs of it: the tension in his jaw and his forehead, the hyperawareness of every scent (the ocean, Sadie\u2019s hand cream, rotting fruit in a garbage can outside), the bile in his throat, the electric pulses up his spine, the throb, the ache, the pulse of the missing limb.

Marx had been the captain of the chess team, and the team had gone across town to compete with another high school chess team. (Marx\u2019s school was number two in Tokyo; the other team, number one.) When they arrived at the other high school, they found that the building was almost identical to their high school, but with everything in reverse. The high schools must have been built at the same time and from the same architectural plans. The team had joked that maybe they would find alternate versions of themselves and their teachers in the buildings. The captain of the other chess team had introduced himself to Marx quite formally: \u201cTeam Captain Watanabe, I am your counterpart.\u201d He could still hear the Katakana in the way the boy had pronounced the English loanword \u201ccounterpart.\u201d",

But Zoe could sense Marx\u2019s distance. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.  \nCounterpart High came out the second week of February 2001 and was an instant best seller for Unfair. By its third week of release, Counterpart High, or CPH, as it was known by fans, had significantly outsold Both Sides, and Marx immediately set the boys to making a sequel.

When Marx needed privacy, Sadie would use Sam\u2019s office, or she would walk home to Clownerina. Sadie didn\u2019t mind losing her office. She and Sam hadn\u2019t settled on an idea for their next game, and she wasn\u2019t working much anyway. They occasionally tossed concepts back and forth, but nothing seemed to inspire either of them to action.

She was still only twenty-five, but until that point, she had always been the youngest in any room she\u2019d been in, and she had derived power from that. Even though Simon and Ant were only a handful of years younger than her, they seemed like they were from a different generation than Sadie and Sam. They didn\u2019t have the same issues she had. They liked sequels! They didn\u2019t care about building their own engines, or who got credit for what, or where a good idea came from. They had been playing games since they were in diapers.

She had, in fourteen years, only intentionally touched him a handful of times, and he had always seemed uncomfortable when she did.  \nAnd in the end, she had decided she preferred being his creative partner to being his lover. There were so many people who could be your lover, but, if she was honest with herself, there were relatively few people who could move you creatively.

It reminded Marx of his days playing D&D with Sam, though nostalgia was not Marx\u2019s primary reason for playing it.

He was a perfect traveling companion.  \n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. She bowed her head to him.  \n\u2014  \nOn the fifth night of their trip, they had dinner with Marx\u2019s mother at her apartment. Marx\u2019s parents were not divorced, but they lived separately.  \nMarx\u2019s mother was a textile designer and teacher. She wore stylish, shapeless, boldly patterned garments and had her hair cut in a severe bob.  \nThe dress she was wearing on that evening was a cotton polka-dot print that precisely matched the curtains that were behind her.  \nMrs. Watanabe had gotten the wrong idea about who Sadie was. She thought Sadie was Marx\u2019s longtime girlfriend, and that Marx and Sadie were on the verge of marriage. \u201cNo, Mom, this is Sadie, not Zoe. Sadie is my business partner.\u201d  \nMarx\u2019s mother took a long look at Sadie, and then she said, \u201cAre you certain?\u201d",

The window of opportunity might close.\u201d  \n-----",
    "617": "\u201cI\u2019m American. I know that,\u201d Mrs. Watanabe said. \u201cBut Sadie is the boss, right? It\u2019s fine if she says it\u2019s fine. You two would make a pretty couple.\u201d  \n\u201cMrs. Watanabe,\u201d Sadie pivoted. \u201cMarx says you teach textile design.  \nI\u2019d be interested in hearing about that.\u201d  \nMrs. Watanabe loved hand painting, quilting, and the discipline of woven textiles, but she worried these techniques were a dying art.  \n\u201cComputers make everything too easy,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cPeople design very quickly on a monitor, and they print on some enormous industrial printer in a warehouse in a distant country, and the designer hasn\u2019t touched a piece of fabric at any point in the process or gotten her hands dirty with ink. Computers are great for experimentation, but they\u2019re bad for deep thinking.\u201d  \n\u201cMom, you know Sadie and I work in computers, right?\u201d",
    "618": "\u201cMom, you know Sadie and I work in computers, right?\u201d  \n\u201cA great textile, like the William Morris Strawberry Thief, is a piece of art, but it takes a lot of time to make a piece of art. It isn\u2019t simply design either. You have to understand the fabrics and what they can bear. You have to understand the dyeing process and how to achieve certain colors and what will make the color last through the ages. If you make a mistake, you might have to begin again.\u201d  \n\u201cI don\u2019t think I know Strawberry Thief,\u201d Sadie said.  \n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Mrs. Watanabe said. Mrs. Watanabe went into her bedroom, and she returned with a little footstool that was upholstered in a reproduction of Strawberry Thief. The pattern depicted birds and strawberries in a garden, and although Sadie hadn\u2019t known the name, she recognized the print when she saw it.  \n-----",
    "619": "Sadie caressed the thick cotton.  \n\u2014  \nBack at the hotel, early the next morning, Marx knocked on her door. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said.  \nShe surprised herself by hoping that the idea would be sex. It turned out to be business.  \n\u201cI had a dream about Strawberry Thief. It was kind of a nightmare,\u201d  \nMarx began. In the dream, Marx is back at his mother\u2019s apartment. His mother tells him to retrieve the stool, but when he gets it, the Strawberry Thief design is rendered in the graphic style of Mapletown. And when he walks out to the living room, his mother is wearing a Strawberry Thief dress rendered in the graphic style of Mapletown, too. And then Marx notices that the whole apartment has been digitized to look like Mapletown.",
    "620": "His mother is an adorable Mapletown sprite. A bubble comes up over her head: Ask me about my Textiles. He dismisses the bubble, but another comes up: Did you know William Morris took one hundred tries to get the dyeing process right for his most famous print textile, Strawberry Thief?  \n\u201cIs that true?\u201d Sadie asked. \u201cI don\u2019t remember your mother saying that.\u201d  \n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Marx said. \u201cThat\u2019s what was in the bubble.\u201d  \nMarx continued describing the dream. \u201cI walk into the kitchen to get some air, and I look out the window. Outside the kitchen window is a man-sized thrush, stealing a strawberry. The scene is quite beautiful, and I\u2019m happy  \n-----",
    "621": "Sadie considered Marx\u2019s question. She could tell where Marx was going without him having to say. Cut out the cancer that was Myre Landing.  \nGive Mapletown away for free, and monetize its maintenance (servers, new quests and levels) through additional purchases\u2014upgrades for the characters, the furnishings, the residences and expansions. If people liked it, the game could be a cash cow. It could be like EverQuest, but without the fantasy story line. It could be like Harvest Moon, but less provincial and not centered on farming\u2014just a pleasant small town in America. Let people build their own characters in the gorgeous, evocative backdrop Sam had created. Sadie could see the merit in this strategy. She knew that people preferred Sam\u2019s world to hers. Seeing Marx in the doorway, it was clear that he knew it, too. \u201cNothing. Except a ton of work,\u201d Sadie said.",
    "622": "They spent the next several hours brainstorming ideas for a rebooted Mapletown. Around four in the morning, they called Sam back in California. Marx explained to him what they had been discussing.  \nA long pause, before Sam responded, \u201cI like this idea a lot, but Sadie, you\u2019re cool with this?\u201d  \n\u201cI am,\u201d she said. \u201cMyre Landing will still exist to those who bought the original game, but I think this is an opportunity to bring Mapletown to a larger audience. If it doesn\u2019t work, all we\u2019ve lost is a lot of time and money.\u201d  \nSam laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d he said.  \nThey spoke with Sam a little longer, and then they hung up. Once again, it was too early to go down to breakfast. \u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Sadie said.  \nHe took her to an all-night conbini that was a short walk from their hotel. He bought egg salad, chicken croquette, and strawberry-and-cream  \n-----",
    "623": "he said. They took the sandwiches up to Marx\u2019s hotel room and they spread their convenience-store feast on a towel on the bed.  \nThe sun was rising over Tokyo.  \n\u201cThis is the best egg salad sandwich I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Sadie said.  \n\u201cYou\u2019re easy to please,\u201d Marx said. He wiped a smudge of egg salad from the side of her mouth.  \n\u2014  \nOn the seventh night of their trip to Tokyo, Marx went to an izakaya with two of his closest high school friends: Midori, who was half-Japanese, and Swan, who was full Japanese but had been born in England. As was their tradition, they consumed profuse amounts of greasy appetizers, yakitori, and warmed sake. The izakaya was a dive; it was the same place they\u2019d frequented in high school, only the guy running it now was the son instead of the father.",
    "624": "Marx asked Sadie if she wanted to come along. Normally, she would have absented herself from such a meeting of old friends, but since they\u2019d come up with the idea to reboot Mapletown, she felt more relaxed and celebratory.  \nWhen they arrived at the izakaya, it became clear to Sadie that the friends, like Marx\u2019s mother, had the impression that Sadie was Marx\u2019s longtime girlfriend, Zoe.  \n\u201cNo,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cSorry. We just work together.\u201d  \n\u201cDarn it,\u201d Midori said. \u201cWe thought we were finally going to meet the girl who made Marx settle down.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat was Marx like in high school?\u201d Sadie asked.  \n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re supposedly not his girlfriend, we can tell you,\u201d  \n-----",
    "625": "\u201cAnd Marx dated everyone,\u201d Midori said, laughing. Sadie recognized the vaudevillian rhythm of an oft-repeated joke.  \n\u201cIf he\u2019d been a girl,\u201d Midori said, \u201ceveryone would have called him a slut, but he was just a stud.\u201d  \n\u201cHe was like that in college, too,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cNot news to me. Did either of you ever date him?\u201d  \n\u201cHe took me to a school dance once,\u201d Midori said. \u201cHe was an excellent date, but it was a friends\u2019 thing.\u201d  \n\u201cThat\u2019s Marx\u2019s redeeming feature,\u201d Swan said. \u201cHe is a great friend, and that\u2019s why no one can ever hate him.\u201d  \n\u201cDid you ever date him?\u201d Midori asked Sadie.  \n\u201cGod, no. He was friends with my friend,\u201d Sadie said.  \n\u201cShe didn\u2019t like me much,\u201d Marx said. \u201cShe may still not like me.\u201d  \n\u201cHow can anyone not like Marx?\u201d Swan said.  \n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Midori asked.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cHe said we could use his apartment for the summer and then he ended up staying in it.\u201d  \n\u201cIs that why you didn\u2019t like me?

Kanpai!\u201d Sadie, Midori, and Swan repeated.  \n\u201cWho\u2019s Sam?\u201d Midori said, laughing.  \nThey drank several rounds of sake, not enough liquor for Sadie to be drunk, but enough for her to feel pleasantly warm inside.  \nMidori went outside to have a smoke, and Sadie went with her. \u201cI was so in love with him, you know,\u201d Midori said.  \nSadie nodded, because she didn\u2019t know what to say.  \n\u201cNever ever ever sleep with Marx. Whatever you do, don\u2019t do it,\u201d  \nMidori warned. \u201cAt some point, he\u2019ll look at you with those eyes and that hair, and you\u2019ll think he\u2019s harmless. He\u2019s hot. I should sleep with him.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019ve known him for six years,\u201d Sadie said. \u201cI doubt that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d  \nAh, but Sadie Green was a gamer! In a game, if a sign warns you not to open a certain door, you will definitely open that door. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you can always go back to the save point and start again.",
    "628": "Sadie and Marx took a cab back to the hotel. They rode the elevator up to their rooms, which were on the twentieth floor. While walking her to her room, Marx said something about twenty being a significant number and that when a person turned twenty (not eighteen, or twenty-one) in Japan, they were considered an adult. \u201cIt\u2019s called hatachi.\u201d  \n\u201cI was twenty when I met you,\u201d Sadie said.  \n\u201cIndeed.\u201d  \nThey were standing outside her door, and he turned to go to his room.  \n\u201cMarx?\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to get into a relationship right now.\u201d  \n-----",
    "629": "\u201cBut I do think it would be a good idea if we slept together,\u201d she said.  \n\u201cWe\u2019re in a different country, and the sex you have when you\u2019re away doesn\u2019t have to count, in my opinion.\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m unfamiliar with that custom.\u201d He walked back to her door.  \nSadie had often reflected that sex and video games had a great deal in common. There were certain objectives that needed to be met. There were certain rules that shouldn\u2019t be broken. There was a correct combination of movements\u2014button mashes, joystick pivots, keystrokes, commands\u2014that made the whole thing work or not work. There was a pleasure to knowing you had played the game correctly and a release that came when you reached the next level. To be good at sex was to be good at the game of sex.",
    "630": "Sadie did not remember much about the first time she had sex with Marx, but she remembered afterward how profoundly comfortable she felt, how easy. His body molded naturally against hers; his scent, barely there, just soap and clean skin; the feeling that there was the right amount of companionable space between them. I am here with you, his body seemed to say, but I acknowledge that we are separate beings. But in the end, she did not know if these feelings were attributable to Marx himself, or all the sake and yakitori she had consumed, or the crisp white hotel duvet, or the fact that she was 5,500 miles from home.  \nShe closed her eyes for a second, and she imagined herself back under the red gates of Nezu.  \nA gate and a gate and a gate.  \nAnd at the end of all the gates, Marx. Marx, in a white linen shirt and rolled-up khakis and a silly straw fedora that Zoe had bought him at the Rose Bowl Flea Market. He takes off the hat, and he tips it to her.",
    "631": "She turned onto her side to smile at Marx in bed. \u201cI love this city,\u201d she said.  \n-----",

There is always a point where one despairs of one\u2019s luggage ever arriving, but not long after the siren, Marx\u2019s bag came. He asked Sadie if she wanted him to wait for her, though this was mainly a formality. Marx\u2019s meeting was at a gaming company in the Valley, and Sadie was headed back to Venice, in the opposite direction. After customs and the shuttle to long-term parking, Marx would barely make his meeting in the Valley as it was. Sadie told him to go on ahead. He kissed her on the cheek. Friends, he said. Always, she said. A half hour later, Sadie\u2019s suitcase was the second-to-last one on the conveyor belt.

Sadie\u2019s metaphor was that it was like buying a house you liked in a bidding war, and then moving that house to a different country by boat, and then once you got the house to the other country, deciding that you liked the materials the house was made from but not, in fact, the house itself, and then building an entirely new house after painstakingly disassembling the old house piece by piece.  \nThe team had worked through the spring and summer to prepare it for online play\u2014everything from creating currency systems to figure out how the game would be monetized in the real world, to setting up its dedicated servers, to renting more office space to accommodate the additional staff.",

He blasted classic rock that reminded him of Anna\u2014the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bowie, Dylan\u2014and he wound his way through Los Angeles and its hills, looking for dead ends that might somehow turn into secret roads.",
    "651": "On one of his drives, a coyote darted out in front of his car. This was Sam\u2019s second first summer in L.A., and the coyotes were everywhere. He would see them in the front yard, sunning themselves, languorously eating fallen fruit from the cherimoya and loquat trees. He would see them loping down the streets of Silver Lake and Echo Park, sometimes in couples or in families, sorting through the trash outside the vegan place on Sunset, hiking stoically in Griffith Park, nursing their young. The coyotes felt capable, canny, and strangely anthropomorphized, as if they had been endowed with human features by a team of animators. Their hair seemed artfully disheveled, the haircut of a hot, young actor playing a drug addict in an independent film. The coyotes felt more human than most of the humans Sam encountered, more human than Sam himself felt back then. Their constant presence made the city feel wild and dangerous, as if he weren\u2019t living in a city at all.",

They drove to an emergency veterinary clinic.  \nThe dog had broken its leg. She needed stitches and would have to be in a cast for a couple of weeks, but she was strong, and she would recover.  \nWhen Sam asked the vet whether the dog might be a coyote, she rolled her eyes. She was just a dog, a mutt yes, but likely some combination of German shepherd, Shiba Inu, and greyhound. You could tell by the elbows, she said. Coyote elbows were higher than dog elbows. She brought up a graphic on her computer: a coyote, next to a wolf, next to a domesticated dog. See, she said, isn\u2019t it obvious? It did not seem obvious to Sam. Nothing seemed obvious to Sam. Yes, it\u2019s obvious, Sam said.  \nSam paid the vet, and then he took the hurt little dog home with him.",
    "654": "Sam paid the vet, and then he took the hurt little dog home with him.  \nHe posted flyers with her photograph around the area in the eastern Hollywood hills where he had hit her, but he was glad when no one responded. He decided he liked having a dog. She distracted him from the discomfort he was in. Having never lived alone before, Sam was lonely, but contradictorily, his pain made him not want to be with people. He named the dog Ruby Tuesday, after the song that had been playing in his car when he\u2019d hit her. He ended up calling her Tuesday.  \nAfter Tuesday had recovered from the broken leg, she could not sleep.  \nSam also had insomnia, so he couldn\u2019t tell if she was just keeping him company. She paced his one-bedroom bungalow, looking haunted, occasionally baying. He took her to the vet again. The vet gave them a prescription for dog Prozac and suggested that they take even longer walks.",

Sometimes, they would laugh at them; sometimes, they would argue.  \nSometimes, they would insist on knowing what she was, as if they might trick Sam into admitting that he had lied and Tuesday was a coyote.  \nSometimes, they would seem angry, as if Tuesday and Sam were deliberately trying to make fools of them. For her part, Tuesday seemed unaware that she was the cause of so much controversy. \u201cPeople,\u201d Sam would say to Tuesday, shaking his head. In her silence, Sam sensed agreement.  \nThey walked uphill and then downhill, until they were spit out at Silver Lake Boulevard, with its small strip of upscale stores and caf\u00e9s. They would then head north around the reservoir, stopping when they reached the dog park.",

Everyone! Get your dogs! NOW!\u201d  \nThere were twenty-five or thirty dogs in the dog park that day. Sam didn\u2019t immediately see the coyote, but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there. Sam called Tuesday and leashed her. It had been her turn to reciprocally sniff the Akita\u2019s ass, so she was reluctant to come.

It looked like a vicious attack.\u201d She petted Tuesday on the head. \u201cGood girl,\u201d she said, as if she were offering Tuesday a benediction. \u201cWhat even is the difference between a coyote and a dog?\u201d  \nSam stammered something about elbows.  \n\u201cWell, these days, you can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d She said that her dog had been attacked by a coyote the week before.

But that would have required her to read the sign, and the woman had not seemed like a reader. Los Angeles, he decided, was a profoundly stupid city, and he felt a palpable, if irrational, longing for all things Massachusetts.  \nHe walked back to his house, and he realized two things: Throughout the encounter, he hadn\u2019t felt any pain.

He could feel the dry California heat and the murderous pounding of his heart.  \nWithout warning, an anecdote he had meant to be amusing did not feel amusing.

And, as he was no longer in chronic pain, he was much better at doing these things than when he\u2019d promoted Ichigo. But, as the promotional schedule had stretched on, Sam had started shifting his appearance away from Mayor Mazer\u2019s. He took to wearing denim coveralls with a name pocket patch embroidered MAZER and a white undershirt underneath. He often wore an army green Breton hat. For years he\u2019d tried to conceal his disability; now he was never photographed without a cane. The cane was used for pointing at things, clearing crowds, grand gestures as needed. He had recently gotten braces and had started wearing contact lenses. For the first time in his life, he was working out with weights, and he became thick with muscle, like a wrestler. He got a tattoo on his right upper arm: umma  \n-----",

He caught her eye for a moment, and then he looked away. A second later, he put on his Breton cap.  \n\u2014  \nOnce Sadie and Marx\u2019s personal relationship was out in the open, Sadie and Sam\u2019s working relationship further deteriorated. Perhaps this was to be expected. The conflicts were the same as they\u2019d always been, but they became less civil with each other.",

What she wanted to do was get back to work on a new game, something that would put Both Sides, Mapleworld, and Ichigo solidly in their rearview mirror.  \nFor his part, Sam enjoyed the process of building out Mapleworld, and he wanted to work on another Ichigo. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many eyes on us right now, Sadie.

Because of the Mayor Mazer character and the Marriages hoopla, Sam was significantly more famous than Sadie. On some level, Master of the Revels was his game, too. His company had produced it; his name was on it; Sadie was his partner. The marketing people broached the idea of Sadie and Sam going on the road together with Marx first.

On some level, you must have known it was him,\u201d Dov said.  \nAt a certain age\u2014in Sadie\u2019s case, thirty-four\u2014there comes a time when life largely consists of having meals with old friends who are passing through town. Dov and Sadie were having brunch at Cliff\u2019s Edge, in Silver Lake. The restaurant looked like a tree house\u2014an enormous, Ent-like, Ficus sprung from the middle of it, and the tables were on tiered wooden platforms that surrounded the tree. The waiters who worked at the restaurant were known for their epic calf strength and their feats of balance.  \nSadie had often thought that working as a waiter at Cliff\u2019s Edge must have been like being a video game character in a dull level of a platformer. As Dov was speaking, the tree caught his eye, and he grabbed one of its thick, smooth branches with his hand. \u201cThis is the most Californian place I\u2019ve ever been. They must think it will never rain,\u201d Dov said.  \n\u201cIt never does,\u201d Sadie said.",

It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone moving a tree this large.\u201d  \n\u201cSadie, you\u2019re in California. It\u2019s a desert. Literally nothing should be here. If someone has a dream of a restaurant that looks like a tree house, Californians make it happen.

Let\u2019s ask the waiter about the tree when he comes,\u201d Dov said. \u201cMarx was smart to move Unfair out here when he did. If I\u2019d had an iota of sense, I would have followed you when you left, gotten on my knees, begged you to take me back.\u201d  \n\u201cYou\u2019re not the getting-on-your-knees type,\u201d Sadie said.  \nWhen the waiter came to take their orders, Dov inquired about the history of the tree. The waiter said he hadn\u2019t been working at the restaurant very long, but he\u2019d ask the manager.  \n\u201cTruly,\u201d Dov said. \u201cYou must have known it was him.\u201d  \n\u201cI did and I didn\u2019t.

It\u2019s called Solution. Since I\u2019m asking you to be vulnerable, I figured that the least I could do was show you the kinds of things I was making back when I was your age. The graphics are old, but give it a play, and tell me what you think. Bear in mind, I was nineteen, and this was about the best you could get done in 1994 in about four weeks, for no money. Also, I guess I should tell you that the game was inspired by my grandmother.\u201d  \nSadie emailed her students a link to Solution.  \nThe class opened their laptops and set themselves to playing Sadie\u2019s juvenilia.

Let\u2019s start with the aesthetics of the game.\u201d  \nThey critiqued every aspect of the game.

In general, the class appreciated the black-and-white graphics, though a boy in a beret asked Sadie if all games in 1994 were black-and-white.

The idea that you could play a game without ever dying or restarting. We\u2019d be playing Super Mario, and if we missed even one gold coin, or got hit by one Koopa, we\u2019d begin again.

So many of the mothers she knew said that their children were exactly themselves from the moment they appeared in the world. But Sadie disagreed. What person was a person without language?  \nTastes?

ReveJeux had several big hits, most famously The Samurai\u2019s Code, a stealth and parkour-style game about a non- gendered team of Samurai. Sadie and Sam both had admired this game, and so they decided to fly to New York to take the meeting.  \nThe group from ReveJeux was young, as people in gaming tended to be, and, in Sadie\u2019s estimation, Sam and herself were the oldest people in the room by  \n-----",

She spoke of Ichigo with rising emotion in her voice. \u201cI want you to know: Ichigo is the game of my heart. But ever since I played Ichigo as a young teenager, I have always felt that the story of Ichigo is incomplete,\u201d Marie said. \u201cMore than anything, I want to see Ichigo grow up.\u201d  \nIn Marie\u2019s proposal for the third Ichigo, Ichigo is now a salaryman, the Japanese version of a suit who takes the train and works a nine-to-five job.",

When the daughter goes missing, Ichigo must shed his salaryman skin to go find her. He must once again don his number 15 jersey to set off on another adventure. The game\u2019s narrative would be split between Ichigo and Ichigo\u2019s daughter. Marie saw Ichigo as a Peter Pan character, and she wanted to make the story as emotional and immersive as Uncharted or Journey.  \n\u201cI must know,\u201d she said. \u201c Why have you never made a third Ichigo?  \nThe game is so brilliant. And you both are so brilliant.\u201d  \nMarie\u2019s colleague, a man in aquamarine glasses, answered for them. \u201cI imagine they have been busy doing other things,\u201d the man said to Marie.

We could play the sample level of Ichigo III together.\u201d  \n\u201cDo you think we should?\u201d  \n\u201cI think we have to play it. We owe it to Ichigo.\u201d",

Lovers are\u2026common.\u201d She studied Sam\u2019s face. \u201cBecause I loved working with you better than I liked the idea of making love to you. Because true collaborators in this life are rare.\u201d  \nSam looked at his hands and at the callus years of gaming had left on his right index finger. \u201cI thought it was because I was poor. And then, when I wasn\u2019t poor, I thought it was because you weren\u2019t attracted to me, because I was half-Asian and because of my disability.\u201d  \n\u201cHow awful do you think I am?

    "1015": "Sam nodded. \u201cYes, if you can believe there was a time when we didn\u2019t know each other. It doesn\u2019t seem possible to me.

    "1016": "And how their traumas inform their games. They, honest to God, think their traumas are the most interesting thing about them. I sound like I\u2019m making fun, and I am a little, but I don\u2019t mean to be. They\u2019re so different from us, really. Their standards are higher; they call bullshit on so much of the sexism and racism that I, at least, just lived with. But that\u2019s also made them kind of, well, humorless. I hate people who talk about generational differences like it\u2019s an actual thing, and here I am, doing it. It doesn\u2019t make sense. How alike were you to anyone we grew up with, you know?\u201d  \n\u201cIf their traumas are the most interesting things about them, how do they get over any of it?\u201d Sam asked.  \n-----",

And if we\u2019d been born a little bit later, there would have been even greater access to the internet and certain tools, but honestly, the games got so much more complicated; the industry got so professional. We couldn\u2019t have done as much as we did on our own. We could never have made a game that we could sell to a company like Opus on the resources we had. We wouldn\u2019t have made Ichigo Japanese, because we would have worried about the fact that we weren\u2019t Japanese. And I think, because of the internet, we would have been overwhelmed by how many people were trying to do the exact same things we were. We had so much freedom\u2014creatively, technically. No one was watching us, and we weren\u2019t even watching ourselves. What we had was our impossibly high standards, and your completely theoretical conviction that we could make a great game.\u201d",

Would Sadie have been the designer she became without Sam\u2019s ambitions for them? And would Sam have had those ambitions without the childhood trauma? She didn\u2019t know.
