In the  \n19th and early 20th centuries, two of America\u2019s wealthiest businessmen  \namassed incredible fortunes that each separately towered over the fortunes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg combined.\nTheir names were Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D.

Soon his business expanded to shipping\ngoods from the West Coast to the East Coast, using Nicaragua as a\npassageway. Eventually, he switched from ships to trains, where he\nmade his largest fortune yet in the railroad business. At his death in\n1877, Vanderbilt\u2019s fortune was estimated to top $100 million, which\nwas more than the US Treasury held at the time. That\u2019s more than\n$200 billion-with-a-\u201cB\u201d in today\u2019s dollars.  \n-----  \nBut even as the richest man in America, Vanderbilt lived a relatively modest life.

But that was  \nthe last time the Vanderbilt family fortune would grow. The Vanderbilt  \nheirs became known as wealthy socialites with a penchant for lavish\nspending. There were ten Vanderbilt mansions built in Manhattan,  \nincluding the largest private residence ever built there, plus several more  \naround the country. Many of these homes seemed more like palaces,\nsuch as The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island, which still stands\ntoday. But without any new money coming in, the fortune couldn\u2019t\nsurvive the spendthrift Vanderbilt heirs.

The family fortune was squandered in just a handful of generations. A direct\ndescendant of Cornelius died broke just 48 years after he did.  \n**The Fortune of John D. Rockefeller**  \nJohn D. Rockefeller made his fortune selling oil and kerosene. He\nstarted Standard Oil of Ohio in 1870, and by the end of the decade\nhis business was refining more than 90% of the oil in the United  \nStates. Rockefeller\u2019s objective was to deliver the best oil at the cheapest  \nprice. He once wrote to a partner, \u201cWe must ever remember we are\nrefining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201d  \n-----  \nAnd Rockefeller succeeded, pushing the price of oil down from 58\ncents to eight cents a gallon.",

The New York Times said in Rockefeller\u2019s 1937 obituary  \nthat he had amassed more than $1.5 billion dollars. In today\u2019s dollars,  \nestimates of his wealth vary between $243 billion and $341 billion.  \nRockefeller was a prolific giver, donating more than $530 million  \nof his fortune to charity during his lifetime. He also left $460 million  \nto his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., otherwise known as \u201cJunior,\u201d in\n1917. Unlike the Vanderbilts, Junior kept the family money together\nby creating a trust for each of his children\u2014a daughter and five sons.\nThe bulk of the family fortune was put into these trusts, managed by\na group of financial professionals referred to as the \u201cFamily Office,\u201d",

And the family is said to donate as much as $50 million\nper year to charity, carrying on the senior Rockefeller\u2019s tradition of\nphilanthropy.  \n**Choosing the Rockefeller Method**  \nWhat made the difference? Why did the Rockefellers keep their fortune while the Vanderbilts lost everything? The answer, ironically, is\nthat the Rockefellers heeded the last words of Vanderbilt. They did\n\u201ckeep the money together,\u201d using trusts as a legal tool to protect the  \nfortune as much as possible from taxes, lawsuits and spendthrift heirs.",

This means that whatever money\nyou are putting into your policy, each year more of it may go toward\nthe life insurance and less toward the investment. Moreover, if the\nmarket is not performing well or other conditions are not ideal, policyholders often end up paying big premiums in later years to keep\nthe policy going.  \nUniversal Life policies have flexible premiums and adjustable death  \nbenefits. The rate at which the cash value in these policies grows is  \ndetermined by the insurance company, and is based primarily on fixed  \nincome rates.

Alternatively, if you live to be 100, many policies will\ncash out when you hit that age, allowing you to literally spend your\ndeath benefit while you are alive.  \nSimply put, you don\u2019t have to die to benefit from a death benefit.\nLet us lay out a few analogies that will help make clear what I mean\nby this. The first is a story from my childhood: when I was in Catholic school, I got into a fight with another kid. The PE teacher came\nup and separated us, saying, \u201cYou guys could get into a lot of trouble\nfor this fight. But what I\u2019m going to do is send you both home with\npermission slips.

    "237": "A death benefit is like that permission slip. It gives you a backup  \nplan, because you know that no matter what, you have an inheritance  \nthat is going to come to your heirs when you die. This gives you the\nfreedom to unlock your other assets, because you are not using your  \n-----  \nother assets as insurance. Instead, you are using insurance as insurance,  \nwhich allows you to tap into lazy assets that don\u2019t produce cash flow,\nand bring them into cash flowing scenarios.  \nHere\u2019s another analogy: imagine that you have an eccentric relative who loves gold. One day, you get a call telling you your relative\nhas died, and has left you $2 million in gold bars. However, there\nis a caveat: your relative has stipulated that you will not receive that\ngold until you turn 80. Now, can that $2 million in gold change your\nlife today, even though you won\u2019t see it until you are 80? Absolutely!\nNow you know, for certain, that when you turn 80 you will receive",

If you know the money will exist\nwhen you are 80, you can spend money differently right now, before\nyou turn 80. A death benefit is much like a future inheritance. You  \ncan leverage the certainty of it coming in, even though you don\u2019t know  \nwhen exactly that is going to happen.  \nLet us give one more analogy of how a death benefit benefits you  \nwhile you are still alive.

Once you have done that, you are no longer required to carry  \nhomeowner\u2019s insurance. \u201cGreat!\u201d you may think. \u201cNow I can save the  \nmoney I was spending on homeowner\u2019s insurance.\u201d But the truth is,\nyou\u2019re not saving money\u2014you are losing money.",

He was in college and worried that starting a business was risky, and that\nit would jeopardize his school pursuits and family responsibilities. But when his brother started\ncleaning windows on the side and making great money doing it, Stephen saw an opportunity.  \nHe started working with his brother, and they quickly found that there was a ready\ndemand for their services. Although his brother quit soon after, Stephen kept at it, and soon  \nwas making more money cleaning windows than he was at his regular job. He found that he\ncould literally go out any day of the week\u2014without any previous jobs scheduled\u2014and make",

He found that he\ncould literally go out any day of the week\u2014without any previous jobs scheduled\u2014and make\nseveral hundred dollars just by knocking on doors and offering his services.  \nBecause he had certainty, a sure knowledge that he could replace the income from his\njob with no risk at all, he quit his job and became an entrepreneur. The shift from employee\nto business owner soon revealed to Stephen some things about himself that he never knew\nbefore. He discovered that he had a gift for creating and implementing systems. He discovered a love for entrepreneurship. He cherished the newfound control he had over his life and\nhis finances. Stephen didn\u2019t necessarily love window cleaning, but he loved the process of\ncreating something that could outlast and grow beyond his individual efforts.

This\nshould be a primary\nconsideration, because  \nif your lifetime max  \nis low, it can be\neliminated by a single\ncatastrophic event, and  \nthen you would\nbe unprotected.  \nConversely, the less certainty in our lives, the more\nfear\u2014and the more fear, the less productivity.  \nOne critical way to remove fear and to increase\ncertainty in our life is to transfer our risks through\nthe proper use of insurance.",
    "368": "Opportunity for Protection  \nThe myth of self-insurance is based on the false idea\nthat we can (and should) drop our insurance coverage\nas soon as we have \u201cenough\u201d assets and accumulated\nmoney. The question I have is, how much in accumulated assets is considered enough: $1 million? $5\nmillion? What is it that determines enough? What if I\naccumulate $5 million, drop all insurance coverage,\nthen get diagnosed with a terminal illness and spend\nmy entire fortune on treatment? Would I think that\nI had enough then? Insurance protection should be\ndesigned to take care of the worst-case scenario.  \nThe fact is that the more assets a person creates,\nthe more they should want to have insurance to\nprotect them. The idea that there will come a time\nin your life when you will not need insurance is a\ncrippling fallacy that is diametrically opposed to the\ncreed of producers: to produce value in any given\nsituation.

The truth is exactly opposite to what is taught in the financial\nindustry. Let me repeat: The more assets you have, the more insurance you\nshould have because the more risk you have of lost production.  \nIf I live in a 1,500-square-foot home and it burns down, it represents\na significant loss of human life value in the form of thought, energy, and",

Yet if I own a 6,000-square-foot home and it burns down, that loss is\nquadrupled. We can either provide a way to indemnify or replace our loss by\ntransferring our risk, or we can retain our risk.  \nContrary to the theory of self-insurance, the more assets a person has, the\nmore there is to protect with insurance. To quote Les McGuire again, \u201cProducers are committed to creating maximum value in all situations, regardless\nof circumstance, and they manage their risk to near zero. Consumers think\nthat risk means losing money; producers know that risk refers to lost production, whether created in the past or yet to be created in the future. Producers\nreduce both risks to near zero.\u201d The most important way that producers mitigate the risk of lost production is through insurance, properly understood\nand wisely utilized.  \n*** * ***",

They understand that production without protection is irresponsible at the best and destructive at the worst.
