    "5": "This book demonstrates that your need for finance, during your lifetime, is much greater than your need for protection. Solve for this need through this instrument and you will end up with more life insurance than the companies will issue on you. Most everyone is familiar with the fact that one can borrow from a whole life policy, but because of how little premiums they pay, there is limited access to money to finance major items needed during a lifetime. Yet, the need for financing for the typical person is extensive. Really, all this book adds to the equation is scale.\nThe fact that the principles have been there all along and no one taught them to me makes me rather angry! Had I known them, life would have been much simpler and much more profitable. Someone should have recognized them and taught them long ago, but this didn\u2019t take place because of the mindset that predominates in the entire financial world.  \n-----",
    "6": "The whole idea is to recapture the interest that one is paying to banks and finance companies for the major items that we need during a lifetime, such as automobiles, major appliances, education, homes, investment opportunities, business equipment, etc.\nThis book is not about investments of any kind. It is about how one finances the things of life, which can certainly include investments. It is not about rates of return. As time goes by interest rates are up and interest rates are down\u2014but the process of banking goes on no matter what is happening. It is a well known fact that banks make more money during times of low interest rates than when rates are high.",
    "7": "A word of caution is in order\u2014later in the book you will be looking at illustrations of life insurance policies that show how the concept works as compared with how most folks go about solving their financial affairs. Most of the illustrations were developed in 2000 and represent dividend scales in effect at that time. Presently, interest earnings are lower and, hence, dividend scales are lower. But in comparison with other methods of financing the things of life, the difference in results remains the same.",
    "8": "It is not a procedure to \u201cget rich quickly.\u201d To the contrary, it requires long range planning. I\u2019m educated as a forester, having worked in that field as a consultant for ten years; I tend to think seventy years in the future. I won\u2019t be here\u2014and neither will you\u2014but there is no reason not to behave in this manner. \u201cPlan as if you are going to live forever and live as if you are going to die today\u201d appears to me to be a good thought. One can learn how to plan and act intergenerationally. That\u2019s one of the primary advantages of having been a forester. I learned to think beyond the lifespan of my current generation.\nBecoming Your Own Banker is not a tax qualified idea of any sort. The Income Tax Law, as we know it today, has only been around since 1913. Life  \n-----",
    "9": "There is no such thing as \u201chaving too much money in the bank.\u201d Wealth must reside somewhere. What better place to have it reside than here?\nFrom this residence one can do anything that one can conceive. This is an advantage that most folks ignore in their thought process, and therefore, limits their effectiveness.\nLet me make it abundantly clear\u2014I am not talking about a bank in the conventional sense of the word. I am demonstrating that one can use dividend paying whole life insurance to solve one\u2019s need for finance throughout one\u2019s life.\nHopefully, this book will give you a new perspective on the idea of \u201cretirement.\u201d I prefer to use the words, \u201cpassive income.\u201d That is money coming in that you can count on and you don\u2019t do anything to earn it at that time. Study the tables carefully and you will see that very high premium, dividend-paying, whole life insurance is the ultimate vehicle to produce such income.",
    "10": "The Infinite Banking Concept is a major paradigm shift for most folks. It will require several thorough readings for a full understanding of its message. The concept is not complicated, it is just different from the way the majority thinks and behaves. In fact, it is the ultimate in simplicity. There is an extensive reading list in the book and you are encouraged to read them all. Education is an on-going process and there is no such thing as having \u201carrived\u201d in knowledge.\nThere have been many people that have had a glimpse of what this book is all about but none, to my knowledge has put together a comprehensive rationale such as you will see here. Read it with an open mind and you will discover a whole new financial world.  \n_\u201cThe problem in America isn\u2019t so much what people don\u2019t know; the problem is what people think they_  \n-----  \n_know that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d_  \n\u2014WILL ROGERS  \n-----",
    "11": "To Frank Vawter, who in the beginning, raised some key thoughts and questions that led me to look deeper into just what is happening in a dividend paying life insurance policy with a mutual company. Kent Basson, \u201cBuddy\u201d Mann, Roland Nelson, Fred Moss, Billy King, Keith Burton, Vince D\u2019Addona and Rob Colburn were also instrumental in this respect.\nA special thanks to Paul Cleveland, Jim Thorington, and Jacqui Neuwirth for their expert assistance in proofreading the manuscript. And to Mike Mallory for putting this book all together and getting it printed.\nThanks to you all for your contribution. I am very grateful for your friendship and your help.  \n-----",
    "12": "Perhaps some of the answer lies in the fact that most folks know next to nothing about the process of banking and its importance to their lives and their well being. Banking is the most important business in the world! Without it, all business comes to a screeching halt. Whenever a business transaction takes place, money must flow from one party to another in a relatively short time or, otherwise, nothing takes place. That flow of money must come from a supply source, a reservoir. That is the essence of what the banking business is all about; someone or some organization has control of a pool of money that can (and must) flow, at a cost, to meet some need.",
    "13": "There is only one pool of money in the world. The fact that this pool is managed by any number of institutions: banks, insurance companies, corporations, and individuals in various countries with various currency denominations is incidental. To argue otherwise would be the equivalent of someone looking at the globe and observing that the Amazon River in South America flows into the Atlantic Ocean and commenting that \u201cthis has nothing to do with the Indian Ocean on the other side of the globe.\u201d Nonsense! It is all part of a system. Observe that about 75% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered  \n-----",
    "14": "The banking business is somewhat like that. Money flows from the pool through our hands to meet our needs\u2014but somewhere in the process it all ends up back into the banking system. It is all a matter of \u201chow much of the banking function do you control as it relates to your needs.\u201d This book is all about how to create your own banking system so that you can control 100% of your needs. Becoming your own banker! Give it your close attention and it can make a radical improvement in your financial future.  \n_\u201cFor I know the plans I have for you\u201d declares the LORD. \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you,_  \n_plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d_  \n\u2014JEREMIAH 29:11  \n-----",
    "15": "Some of it is coming from the life insurance business. I made a good living in life insurance sales for over 30 years. Knowing how dividend- paying life insurance works is an essential ingredient to it all. Most people have a minimal understanding of the subject, including the home office personnel at life insurance companies! That is strange, but very true.\nLastly, it was strongly influenced by my experience in the real estate business. Timber is a form of real estate as well as the land on which it grows, so I have been around real estate for all my working life and I developed a strong interest in the subject, studying many books on it. If you read these books, the central message is not about real estate at all\u2014it is about the magic of leverage! Essentially, they all say, \u201cBuy some real estate, borrow the money to pay for it, (because you are always dealing with borrowed money\u2014you either borrow money and pay interest, or you use  \n-----",
    "16": "That is all true\u2014as long as things are going the way the \u201cfinancial geniuses\u201d describe it. But they never tell you what happens when the lever goes the other way! Frankly, I made some money in the late \u201870s doing it the way the \u201cgeniuses\u201d explained it (someone remarked that \u201cfinancial genius is a rising market\u201d). There were several successful ventures in a row and it looked like there was no end to this bonanza. I could do no wrong! The ventures got bigger and bigger and I got more and more involved, buying a large number of acres of rural property. And then I got into real estate development. With the profits from one small parcel, my wife and I went to Europe in 1977 and spent a month! Would you believe it\u2014I have never seen that property yet? And I did it all according to \u201cthe book by the financial geniuses\u201d\u2014leverage\u2014other people\u2019s money. Just have your Realtor find such a deal and attend to all the particulars for you\u2014and then sell it for you! Marvelous!",
    "17": "There was no logical reason not to expand. And so I did. The interest rate (prime) at that time was 8%, but you must pay 1.5% over \u201cprime\u201d (now referred to as base rate), because the Bankers are not lending you money because you have real estate\u2014they are doing it because they think you can make payments! Why else would they require personal endorsement on the loan? And you must renew the notes every 90 days\u2014at the current interest rate. I got accustomed to paying 9.5% and that was just normal. And then, along came 1981 and 1982. The prime rate rose and \u201cpeaked\u201d at 21.5%!! Add 1.5% on top of that and you see my situation\u201423% interest on $500,000!! That amounts to $67,500 of interest per year that I was not expecting to pay!",
    "18": "When this happens to you, what do you do? Go ask the \u201cfinancial geniuses\u201d who recommended that you do this, \u201cWhat do I do, now?\u201d If you can find them, they may mumble something about \u201cselling the real estate.\u201d But, where do you find a fool that will buy it under those circumstances! Of course, everything will sell if you get the price low enough, but losing five  \n-----",
    "19": "But, so far, you have heard only a part of my story. The beginning of my \u201cawakening\u201d was in November 1980 when our first grandchild was born. Interest rates had begun to zoom upward. That was Bunker Hunt\u2019s heyday\u2014 you remember him? Bunker and his brother were going to \u201ccorner\u201d the silver market\u2014and as a result silver prices increased higher than anything, relatively speaking. Gold went up to $800 per oz. And so, \u201cdrug junkies\u201d started supporting their drug habit by stealing silver from homes. While my wife was visiting our new granddaughter some 60 miles away for several days, the thieves broke into our home at 3:00 P.M. and \u201ccleaned us out.\u201d Have you ever been burglarized? You won\u2019t believe what they can do to a house in just a few minutes. Luckily, I got to clean up the mess. If my wife had seen it I don\u2019t believe she would ever feel comfortable in that house again.",
    "20": "Two months later my 52 year-old brother dropped dead from a heart attack while playing racquetball with a son. Poor selection of ancestors\u2014our father died at age 64 from the same problem.\nFive months later our second granddaughter was born out in Hawaii. Five weeks later her parents discovered that the baby had cancer! I didn\u2019t even know that babies could get cancer. She went on chemotherapy when she was six weeks old. Six months later she went through surgery to remove the tumor on her right adrenal gland. The cancer was a neuroblastoma, a very rare kind that attacks children. The lesions had involved her liver and she had to go back on chemotherapy for several more treatments. My story has a good part\u2014she is now 25 years old and is cured!! We have seen a miracle!",
    "21": "And now for the bad financial news\u2014it was that summer that interest rates went to 23 percent\u2014and there I stood owing $500,000 under those circumstances. When a number of bad things like this occur in fairly rapid succession it can increase the quality of your prayer life dramatically! The basic idea revealed in the Infinite Banking Concept was born over a period of many, many months at 3:00 to 4:00 A.M. in the kneeling position praying, \u201cLord, please, show me a way out of this financial nightmare that I have created for myself.\u201d The answer came back about like a baseball bat across  \n-----",
    "22": "If I had not been accustomed to paying very large premiums it is doubtful that I would have seen the message. Hardship often helps us to see things to which we are normally blind. It was evident to me that I needed to increase my life insurance premiums dramatically to create a pool of cash values from which to borrow to pay off the bankers that I owed. But, I owed $500,000! How could I do both? Honest introspection revealed that I could revise my spending pattern. This was a starting place. When I started teaching others to design their financial dealings along these lines my income tripled. Practically everyone thought I was crazy\u2014it was opposite to what all the \u201cexperts\u201d said. But an objective look at the facts of how life insurance worked, plus reason and logic\u2014and continued sessions of intense prayer for guidance has proved that the system works!!",
    "23": "Maybe you have found yourself in such a financial prison\u2014or maybe you want to develop a system that will keep you out! Maybe yours is smaller or greater. Whatever, the principles are the same and they will serve you well. It requires understanding\u2014and it requires discipline to implement the idea, but it can change your life dramatically\u2014even beyond your fondest dreams!  \n_My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject_  \n_you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children._  \n\u2014HOSEA 4:6  \n-----",
    "24": "The boys got their slates down and started to work on the problem. His plan seemed to be working, except for one boy who just sat there staring out the window. Presently he picked up his slate, wrote down a number and turned it in to the Schoolmaster. Since his was the only correct answer, the Schoolmaster took note of the fact and asked the boy how he did it.\nThe boy said, \u201cI visualized a line with the figure \u20181\u2019 on the left side and the figure \u2018100\u2019 on the right side. Then I cut the line at the halfway point, 50, and folded the scale to the left so that there were now two lines that were parallel. 100 was lined up with 1 on the left side and 50 and 51 were lined up on the right side. Adding the two numbers on each end of the scales was easy to do. I noticed that all the pairs of numbers in between on the scale added up to 101, too, and that there were 50 pairs of the sets of 101. Multiplying 101 times 50 is simple! The total was 5,050.\u201d",
    "25": "Thereafter the young boy received special tutoring and he later became one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time\u2014his name was Karl  \n-----",
    "26": "Young Gauss did not invent that fact\u2014he discovered what God had done already! He discovered a relationship between numbers that is fixed and nothing can be done to change it.\nNow that we understand this fact we can take a shortcut in getting the answer. Whenever we are adding anything beginning with one and ending with a multiple such as ten, one hundred, one thousand, etc. you simply pick the mid-point (in the first case cited above, 50) and simply put that same figure alongside it. (5050). So to add all the numbers 1 through 1,000, you simply pick the mid-point, 500 and put 500 alongside it (500,500). Simple! And accurate! It is fixed. Try to pass some law to change that fact and you are engaging in an exercise in futility.",

The real estate folks say there are three important things about real estate\u2014location, location, and location. For such a property you are going to pay dearly. This is not an overnight activity, either. You are going to have to spend some time locating the right place. Then you must construct a very nice looking building on the property. It must have a well arranged interior with attractive equipment and fixtures and display cases. All this is necessary because your competition has been hard at work for years in attracting customers.

If you sell a can of peas for 60 cents at the front door, you have to replace it at the back door at a cost of 57 cents. (I have found this to be a shocking revelation to most everyone). Grocery stores operate on a very small margin on such items. The can of peas sitting on the shelf for sale represents inventory. You must turn the inventory 15 times just to break even! There is all that interest you must pay on the huge sums of money you have borrowed to buy the land, the building, the signs, advertising, payroll and fringe benefits, utilities, legal fees, accounting, etc., to name a few. Turn it 17 times and you will be profitable. If you can turn the inventory 20 times per year you can retire early! Something dramatic happens once you get over the hump.",

Consider this\u2014over an extended period of time, can she go out the back door with her groceries without the \u201chired help\u201d witnessing her act? I think not. So, what will the \u201chired help\u201d do as a result? They are going to steal groceries, too. You can predict it with certainty.",

The customers who go past the cashier with their goods and pay for them, that\u2019s who! It can\u2019t come from anywhere else. Theft is devastating.

In a proper bank these three items bear a prudent relation to one another. If you are a little country bank with a capital of $100,000, it would be very imprudent of you to loan Brazil $50 million. So you want a prudent relationship between the capital and the assets, which is to say the loans on the books, and between the loans and the deposits. In the Western countries the financial agents of the government are there with a definition of prudence.\u201d  \n-----",

When this sort of thing happens someone has to support the situation, which is normally the function of the stockholders. Because of losses the stockholders\u2019 equity lost 87% of its value down to $12 million. Remember the prudent relationships that Adam Smith outlined above. $12 million in capital in relation to $1.5 Billion in loans is a shaky bank!\nWhen the public found out about it, can you predict what happened to bank deposits at First National at this time? Right! They decreased by $500 million. Remember, this is what banks lend\u2014deposits made by their customers. This accelerated their decline.",

Reading \u201cbetween the lines\u201d it was pretty evident that a lot of those non-performing loans were made to the members of the board of directors. They were making loans to themselves to invest in the oil business where they were going to \u201cmake a killing\u201d and neglecting to repay the loans. There was a big energy crisis just a while before this. When the oil business returned to normal these folks lost both their oil business and their banking business.

But it must be extremely profitable over the long haul for people to go through the gory mess you have just read about. There is a much easier way to accomplish the creation of your own banking system and the mechanism has been around for over 200 years. It is tried and true. It is called participating (i.e. dividend-paying) whole life insurance. But the problem is that very few people know how the business works, including the home office folks in the life insurance companies!\nAt this point, it will help if you understand what is meant by the word \u201cco- generation.\u201d It is a term used in the production of electrical power.

But, do you erect power distribution lines, get a sales force, etc. and ask potential customers if they would like to buy power from you instead of their customary power supplier? Heavens, no! You understand how the power distribution systems all work and simply tie into the established system and sell them the power. It is much more efficient than trying to do it any other way. Creating your own banking system through the use of dividend-paying life insurance is much like co-generation. All the ingredients are already there in place.

Some large developments of urban office buildings have been entirely financed by a single insurance company. This can often include shopping centers.",

If he would solve for the need for finance through dividend-paying life insurance, he would automatically have much more life insurance and recover all the interest he is now paying to someone else. But this almost never occurs because of the mental block implanted by financial geniuses that \u201clife insurance is a poor place to store money.\u201d What a limited outlook of just what is going on in the banking world!

Remember that there is only one pool  \n-----",

Furthermore, he complains about the premium he pays but thinks nothing of the much larger amount he pays the automobile finance company! Strange, isn\u2019t it?\nIn the above example he is paying a total of $310 to the pool: $50 directly and $260 indirectly. If he could muster up the courage to pay the $310 directly to the life insurance company in the form of premiums for around four years, he could now make a policy loan and pay cash for the automobile!",

The insurance agent now needs to make him vividly aware that he must pay the loan back at an interest rate that is at least equivalent to the going interest rate of an automobile finance company\u2014not what the policy calls for. In this case it should be at least $260 per month. If the policyholder does this, then he will effectively make what the finance company would otherwise make and do it all on a tax-free basis. If the agent is really good, and understands the principles of banking, he will encourage the policyholder to pay $275 per month because the \u201cextra\u201d dollars will go to his policy to increase the capital that can be lent to other parties.\nIf the policyholder objects that, \u201cit\u2019s my own money and I am not going to  \n-----",

In the above example of the car financing, the capitalization needs to be somewhat greater than just four years. Many college business professors estimate that corporations expect it to take at least seven years to get back a profit on a new investment. This is an understatement in certain undertakings. So, why not capitalize each policy purchased for at least 7 years, to the point where dividends will pay all the remaining premiums on the policy.

Several years ago Dartmouth Business Professor, James Bryan Quinn, estimates that corporations expect it to take at least seven years to get back a profit on a new investment. Taking a clue from this fact, why not accumulate money over a seven-year period of time and at a somewhat higher annual amount, say $5,000.",
    "146": "This person accumulates money on a monthly basis in a savings account and buys a Certificate of Deposit (at someone else\u2019s bank) in the amount of $5,000 with a yield of 5.5% interest. Show me someone that will do this for seven years just to build a banking system and I will show you someone that has conquered Parkinson\u2019s Law. He will win by default in comparison with his peers, because they can\u2019t discipline themselves to do so. This person will also attract the attention of the Willie Sutton types\u2014the Internal Revenue Service\u2014and they will take 30% of the earnings. The net effect is that he will earn 4% after taxes. Table (1) will show the results of this procedure. The C/D account now has an aftertax amount of $41,071.13. It is time to start the self-financing of car purchases from the system now.

    "150": "METHOD E\u2014The FIFTH method is using dividend-paying life insurance as a depositary of the necessary capital to create the banking system to finance the automobiles. This person puts the same $5,000 per year, as in the foregoing method, into very high-premium life insurance with a mutual life insurance company. Recall Figure 4 back on page 55. (There are some exceptions to this requirement. There are some stock companies that have dividend-paying policies). After the seven years of capitalization, this person withdraws dividends in the amount required to pay cash for the car. This process does not involve policy loans. In order to play honest banker with himself, he must make premium payments to the policy instead of to a finance company\u2014but in the same amount that he would have to pay to one, in this case, $3,030 per year\u2014the same as the person using Method D.\nNotice that in Table (1) the results favor Method D up through year 14\u2014  \n-----",

The cost of administration in both cases is a \u201cwash.\u201d Look at year 51 in Table 1 (page 67) and compare the difference between the two methods. The difference is what went to the stockholders at the bank in Method D, if it was accumulated on a tax-deferred basis for that period of time ($964,638 \u2013 $258,927 = $705,710). To make all this money the Banker had to go through that gory mess that was described in Chapter 4. But, hardly anyone takes this into consideration.

    "153": "This is the essence of what The Infinite Banking Concept is all about\u2014 recovering the interest that one normally pays to some banking institution and then lending it to others so that the policy owner makes what a banking institution does. It is like building an environment in the airplane world where you have a perpetual \u201ctailwind\u201d instead of a perpetual \u201cheadwind.\u201d Simple, isn\u2019t it? Controlling the environment is much more productive than trying to make the airplane fly 5 miles per hour faster!\nLet\u2019s review the \u201cCharacters in the Play\u201d once more--Shakespeare said, \u201cAll the world is a stage and all the people are actors thereon.\u201d Acknowledging this thought from him, I say, \u201cWhen it comes to the subject of finance, frankly, most folks don\u2019t understand the play. Worse than that, they can\u2019t get the characters in the play straight!\u201d",
    "154": "So, let\u2019s compare the activity and characters in a conventional bank and that of a life insurance contract with a mutual, dividend-paying company. A bank can\u2019t operate without \u201chired help.\u201d Neither can a life insurance company. A bank must lend money or it is not in business. So does a life insurance company. (These two items are a \u201cwash.\u201d) The stockholder at the bank earns dividends. So does the life policy owner. The C/D holder at a bank earns interest. So does the life policy owner (guaranteed cash value).\nThe only difference in the two is how earnings are allocated. The life policy owner gets both interest (guaranteed cash value) AND dividends!\nIn Table 1 (page 67), there is a difference in values in the early years up through year 14, though the outlay and car purchases, along with repayments  \n-----",
    "155": "In order to issue a C/D a banker has to create a bank. From the start of the idea until it\u2019s \u201cbreak even\u201d point, it will take the average bank about 15 years. Practically no one seems to recognize this fact.\nSo, what is the banker\u2019s reward for all his efforts? Look at year 51 and compare the results of each method. Subtract the $258,927 from the $964,638 and you have isolated what went to the banker, if it has been compounded over that period of years. The death benefit is not a factor in this comparison. It is a bonus to the policy owner.",
    "156": "Note that Table 2 (page 68) does not show any policy loans to make the car purchases. The\npurchases are made by use of dividend withdrawals.  \nIf I were in the life insurance business, I would never suggest that a client do it this way.\nI would recommend policy loans to buy the cars.  \nThere is a simple reason for this procedure. Remember, the earlier one starts a life\ninsurance policy\u2014and the longer it stays in force\u2014the more efficient it gets. When one\nsurrenders Paid-Up Additional Insurance, you are surrendering a small portion of Paid-Up\nInsurance that has recently been created. Hence, you are killing the growth potential of that  \n-----  \nmuch of the policy. If you use policy loans, instead, then you are not terminating this\npotential. The policy values continue to grow.  \nSo, you ask, \u201cWhy are you demonstrating dividend surrenders?\u201d Simply because there\nare many people when they see the word \u201cloan,\u201d their brain goes into deep freeze. \u201cLoan",

You will see this more clearly when you get\nto the Equipment Financing section on page 75 (Part IV).  \nThere are only two hard, fast rules in building and in carrying out this concept:  \n1. Don\u2019t be afraid to capitalize the system. The more capital you put into it, the  \nmore you get back, tax-free at \u201cpassive income\u201d time (some folks refer to this as  \n\u201cretirement income\u201d but, I\u2019m removing the word \u201cretirement\u201d from my vocabulary).  \n2.

He paid $65,790 for the truck, with $13,190 down payment and financed $52,600 for four years. To amortize the indebtedness requires a monthly payment of $1,502 per month (item 10).

At the end of four years he has paid out $72,096 (item 8). He financed $52,600, so a little \u201cthird grade arithmetic\u201d reveals that he paid $19,496 in interest (item 7) over the period.",

This time, the dealer may allow him a trade-in value of something like $18,000. But, the price of the new truck has gone up, too, and he keeps financing about $52,600 on every truck that he buys.

Again, there is $157,363 available for loan at the end of the first four years. In this case he must repay $36,000 per year in order to be an \u201chonest banker\u201d with himself. Now, look at line 36, column 6, and you see $2,459,578 in cash value. He has picked up an additional $471,324 by shopping at home for his truck financing.

He would be much wiser to establish a \u201cbranch office\u201d to his banking system by capitalizing another policy. Nevertheless, it is theoretically possible to do so with this one.\nLook at Table 6. Notice the end result at line 36, column 6\u2014there is $2,928,933 in cash value. The dividend income at retirement time is up to $175,000 per year, resulting in recovering his capital input, plus $2,675,959 in total income by age 85\u2014and still delivers $5,085,598 to his beneficiary.",
    "198": "Remember, the wisest thing he could do is add additional policies to his banking system as early as possible to enhance his ability to finance his entire inventory of equipment. But, he can still improve on the results of the last example. Look at Table 7. It is the same as the previous one until line 13. At this point he can finance all four of his logging trucks plus one of the logging tractors. (Logging tractors cost twice as much as trucks. And the Treeshear costs even more than that). Now note the cash value at his age 65 is $3,518,411. Compare this with the cash value in Table 3, where the company \u201cgophers\u201d did all the lending to other borrowers ($1,517,320) and you see that \u201cshopping at home\u201d resulted in over $2,000,000 in additional value.",
    "199": "Also, note the yearly dividend in column 5, line 36 in Table 3 ($71,942). Now, compare it with the same point in Table 6 ($140,279). The life insurance company\u2019s dividend scale did not change! They had nothing to do with this improvement. It was all on account of what the policy-owner did. The \u201cgophers\u201d at the life insurance company made just as much money in the first illustration as they did in the last illustration. In fact, the \u201cgophers\u201d cannot make a profit. They earn salaries, and can earn bonuses, if their efforts are superior\u2014but only the policy owners can \u201cmake money\u201d through improved dividends. The difference in results goes to his policy\u2014not the general portfolio of the company.\nAt this point, consideration should be given to how to improve the results even further.

I strongly recommend that you find a life insurance agent that is thoroughly familiar with The Infinite Banking Concept to act as your coach. In all probability such an agent will be thoroughly familiar with questionnaires that will help you find out just how you are spending money now and show you ways to re-direct that cash flow to build your banking system. Above all, you must be patient. It is going to take years to get started\u2014and it needs to be a lifetime commitment.\nIt is much like developing a regimen of physical conditioning.

Today, as an educator, I want to inspire\nstudents to learn, to teach my students so they could teach others. But since the subject of\nmy scholarly passion is business, my students only want what they see as job\ncertification. Many want credits but don\u2019t want to learn.  \nSince learning requires involvement of the students, a basic problem of modern\neducation is the students who don\u2019t want to be in school. High school is something to be\nendured; they go to college only because a parent or school counselor told them to go.\nUnfortunately, as students are told to go to school, it is never emphasized that learning\nitself has value.",

It is amazing how many people got into business education not\nbecause of a love of scholarship but because they were not very successful as business\nprofessionals. Now some former practitioners can be (and are) very respected scholars.\nShifting from business practice to education can be a satisfying shift of career.  \nBut it is a business school, not a business.

It is no\nsurprise that the graduates, like faculty, often leave with a world view as expansive as\nthat of a pet goldfish.\u201d  \nProfessor Rotfeld went on to quote IBM chief executive Louis V.

    "293": "Next, I assumed the Insured retired at age 70 (I no longer let people get away with the assumption of age 65 for retirement. It is just not going to work in the future) and surrendered dividend credits from that point on. Based on the current dividend scale of this company the cash values at age 70 were illustrated to be $2,457,303. Withdrawing dividend credits alone of $145,000 per year for retirement purposes could be sustained indefinitely.  \n-----",
    "294": "In all honesty, I don\u2019t believe that the college degree would produce comparable financial results. This scenario assumed that the Insured simply let the insurance company manage the cash values throughout the entire illustration.\nIf the Insured were taught to finance his automobile purchases through the policy ($21,450 financing package every four years, beginning at the first of the 5th year) and paid back to the policy that which he would have had to pay a finance company (6,500 per year for four years), then the results improve significantly. In this case, $2,698,593 in cash value, and the income from dividends could be increased to $150,000 per year (total income of $2,250,000 by age 85) plus a death benefit of $3,848,202 if death occurred at that time. In this example there were no policy loans at all. The $21,450 \u201cautomobile financing\u201d packages were all withdrawals of dividend credits. The \u201crepayments\u201d were actually premiums to the base policy.",
    "295": "By the way, if the Insured was female, the above results improve even more\u2014in this case $2,959,517 cash value at age 70, dividend income of $150,000 per year ($2,250,000 in income by age 85) plus a death benefit of $5,233,432 if death occurred at age 85. The death benefit continues to increase if death occurs later.",
    "296": "So, in evaluating just the financial benefits of the college degree at a cost of $80,000 vs. putting that same $80,000 into high-premium whole life insurance, I don\u2019t believe the degree is as valuable. As a matter of fact, the probability of the college educated person ever learning the benefits of \u201cbanking\u201d through the use of whole life insurance is not very good. He will be exposed to some professor teaching him that \u201cwhole life insurance is a very poor place to put money.\u201d It will take a lot of effort to get this notion out of his head, because \u201cunlearning\u201d is more difficult than learning.
