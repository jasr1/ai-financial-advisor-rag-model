# RAG LLM for Financial Queries

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** designed to provide AI-powered answers to financial queries using company-provided documents. The model retrieves relevant information using **FAISS vector stores** and generates responses with **GPT APIs**, ensuring users receive accurate, real-time answers.

## Project Overview
Videre Financiers required an AI-driven solution to answer client financial inquiries accurately and efficiently. This **RAG-based chatbot** enables users to receive real-time financial insights without needing to contact a human representative.

### How It Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Document Processing** ‚Äì Company-provided financial documents are converted into vector embeddings.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Efficient Retrieval** ‚Äì A **FAISS vector store** quickly retrieves relevant information.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Conversational AI** ‚Äì The chatbot integrates **GPT APIs** to generate accurate responses.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Contextual Memory** ‚Äì Multi-turn interactions maintain conversational flow for a natural experience.
